1
00:00:26,322 --> 00:00:30,701
This is the Asgardian
refugee vessel Statesman.

2
00:00:33,454 --> 00:00:36,916
We are under assault.
I repeat, we are under assault.

3
00:00:37,083 --> 00:00:40,628
The engines are dead,
life support failing.

4
00:00:40,795 --> 00:00:43,756
Requesting aid from
any vessel within range.

5
00:00:43,923 --> 00:00:46,884
We are 22 jump points out of Asgard.

6
00:00:48,027 --> 00:00:50,414
Our crew is made up
of Asgardian families.

7
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:52,257
We have very few soldiers here.

8
00:00:52,306 --> 00:00:56,269
This is not a warcraft.
I repeat, this is not a warcraft.

9
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:12,743
Hear me and rejoice.

10
00:01:16,539 --> 00:01:21,544
You have had the privilege
of being saved by the Great Titan.

11
00:01:24,505 --> 00:01:26,716
You may think this is suffering.

12
00:01:27,925 --> 00:01:28,926
No.

13
00:01:29,969 --> 00:01:32,305
It is salvation.

14
00:01:36,184 --> 00:01:41,731
Universal scales tip toward balance
because of your sacrifice.

15
00:01:43,357 --> 00:01:44,817
Smile.

16
00:01:45,818 --> 00:01:50,656
For even in death,
you have become Children of Thanos.

17
00:02:06,088 --> 00:02:08,132
I know what it's like to lose.

18
00:02:10,301 --> 00:02:13,262
To feel so desperately that you're right...

19
00:02:14,013 --> 00:02:16,766
yet to fail, nonetheless.

20
00:02:24,857 --> 00:02:26,484
It's frightening.

21
00:02:27,819 --> 00:02:29,779
Turns the legs to jelly.

22
00:02:31,906 --> 00:02:34,033
But I ask you, to what end?

23
00:02:35,451 --> 00:02:38,037
Dread it, run from it...

24
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,624
destiny arrives all the same.

25
00:02:42,834 --> 00:02:44,669
And now, it's here.

26
00:02:45,253 --> 00:02:47,088
Or should I say...

27
00:02:48,422 --> 00:02:49,924
I am.

28
00:02:55,346 --> 00:02:56,722
You talk too much.

29
00:02:58,015 --> 00:02:59,433
The Tesseract.

30
00:02:59,851 --> 00:03:01,978
Or your brother's head.

31
00:03:06,649 --> 00:03:09,026
I assume you have a preference.

32
00:03:10,278 --> 00:03:11,571
Oh, I do.

33
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:14,991
Kill away.

34
00:03:30,298 --> 00:03:31,382
All right, stop!

35
00:03:34,969 --> 00:03:36,929
We don't have the Tesseract.

36
00:03:37,096 --> 00:03:38,890
It was destroyed on Asgard.

37
00:03:49,734 --> 00:03:52,570
You really are the worst brother.

38
00:03:57,658 --> 00:03:59,535
I assure you, brother...

39
00:03:59,702 --> 00:04:01,704
the sun will shine on us again.

40
00:04:03,623 --> 00:04:06,584
Your optimism is misplaced, Asgardian.

41
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,713
Well, for one thing, I'm not Asgardian.

42
00:04:11,255 --> 00:04:12,089
And for another...

43
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:15,760
we have a Hulk.

44
00:04:28,147 --> 00:04:29,816
Let him have his fun.

45
00:05:22,118 --> 00:05:23,578
Allfathers...

46
00:05:25,454 --> 00:05:28,708
let the dark magic flow
through me one last...

47
00:05:29,542 --> 00:05:30,626
time.

48
00:05:45,391 --> 00:05:46,934
That was a mistake.

49
00:05:52,815 --> 00:05:54,484
No!

50
00:06:03,618 --> 00:06:06,245
You're going to die for that.

51
00:06:17,507 --> 00:06:19,258
My humble personage...

52
00:06:20,676 --> 00:06:22,970
bows before your grandeur.

53
00:06:26,265 --> 00:06:29,477
No other being has ever had the might...

54
00:06:29,894 --> 00:06:31,562
nay, the nobility...

55
00:06:31,938 --> 00:06:36,651
to wield not one, but two Infinity Stones.

56
00:06:40,112 --> 00:06:44,534
The universe lies within your grasp.

57
00:07:23,781 --> 00:07:26,534
There are two more stones on Earth.

58
00:07:27,994 --> 00:07:31,497
Find them, my children,
and bring them to me on Titan.

59
00:07:31,789 --> 00:07:33,207
Father, we will not fail you.

60
00:07:33,374 --> 00:07:34,876
If I might interject.

61
00:07:36,043 --> 00:07:39,338
If you're going to Earth,
you might want a guide.

62
00:07:40,256 --> 00:07:42,884
I do have a bit of experience in that arena.

63
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:45,261
If you consider failure experience.

64
00:07:45,428 --> 00:07:48,181
I consider experience experience.

65
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:50,892
Almighty Thanos...

66
00:07:51,184 --> 00:07:55,855
I, Loki, prince of Asgard...

67
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:00,860
Odinson...

68
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:06,699
the rightful king of Jotunheim...

69
00:08:07,325 --> 00:08:09,202
god of mischief...

70
00:08:10,077 --> 00:08:11,579
do hereby pledge to you...

71
00:08:12,997 --> 00:08:16,876
my undying fidelity.

72
00:08:27,428 --> 00:08:28,930
Undying?

73
00:08:32,725 --> 00:08:35,394
You should choose 
your words more carefully.

74
00:08:40,105 --> 00:08:50,994

75
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:57,917
You...

76
00:08:59,043 --> 00:09:00,628
will never be...

77
00:09:03,339 --> 00:09:04,423
a god.

78
00:09:14,767 --> 00:09:15,768
No!

79
00:09:30,741 --> 00:09:33,244
No resurrections this time.

80
00:09:56,851 --> 00:09:59,020
No. Loki.

81
00:10:37,809 --> 00:10:40,728
Seriously, you don't have any money?

82
00:10:40,895 --> 00:10:43,940
Attachment to the material is
detachment from the spiritual.

83
00:10:44,106 --> 00:10:45,399
I'll tell the guys at the deli.

84
00:10:45,566 --> 00:10:47,443
Maybe they'll make you
a metaphysical ham on rye.

85
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:49,445
Wait, wait, wait. I think I have 200.

86
00:10:49,612 --> 00:10:50,613
Dollars?

87
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:52,114
- Rupees.
- Which is?

88
00:10:53,032 --> 00:10:54,116
Buck and a half.

89
00:10:54,283 --> 00:10:55,493
What do you want?

90
00:10:56,118 --> 00:10:58,287
I wouldn't say no to a tuna melt.

91
00:11:10,758 --> 00:11:12,718
Thanos is coming.

92
00:11:13,261 --> 00:11:14,512
He's coming.

93
00:11:18,683 --> 00:11:19,976
Who?

94
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:29,735
Slow down, slow down.

95
00:11:29,902 --> 00:11:31,779
- I'll spell it out for you. No, I'm not.
- You're totally rambling. You lost me.

96
00:11:31,946 --> 00:11:34,699
Look, you know how you're having a dream,
and in the dream you gotta pee.

97
00:11:34,866 --> 00:11:35,867
- Yeah.
- Okay.

98
00:11:36,033 --> 00:11:38,411
And then you're like, "Oh, my God.
There's no bathrooms. What am I gonna do?

99
00:11:38,578 --> 00:11:39,495
- "Oh, someone's watching."
- Right.

100
00:11:39,662 --> 00:11:40,830
- "I'm gonna go in my pants."
- And then you wake up...

101
00:11:40,997 --> 00:11:42,623
and in real life you actually have to pee.

102
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:43,875
- Yes.
- Yeah.

103
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:45,168
- Okay.
- Everybody has that.

104
00:11:45,334 --> 00:11:47,044
Right, that's the point I'm trying to make.

105
00:11:47,378 --> 00:11:51,340
Apropos of that, last night I dreamt
we had a kid.

106
00:11:51,966 --> 00:11:53,176
It was so real.

107
00:11:53,551 --> 00:11:55,970
We named him after your eccentric uncle.
What was his name?

108
00:11:56,137 --> 00:11:58,389
- Right.
- Morgan! Morgan.

109
00:11:58,556 --> 00:12:00,183
- So you woke up...
- Naturally.

110
00:12:00,349 --> 00:12:01,934
...and thought that we were...

111
00:12:02,101 --> 00:12:03,186
- Expecting.
- Yeah.

112
00:12:03,352 --> 00:12:04,228
- Yes?
- No.

113
00:12:04,395 --> 00:12:05,771
I had a dream about it. It was so real.

114
00:12:05,938 --> 00:12:09,358
If you wanted to have a kid,
you wouldn't have done that.

115
00:12:10,026 --> 00:12:11,903
I'm glad you brought this up,
'cause it's nothing.

116
00:12:12,069 --> 00:12:13,488
It's just a housing unit for nanoparticles.

117
00:12:13,654 --> 00:12:16,282
- You're not helping your case, okay?
- No, this is detachable. It's not a...

118
00:12:16,449 --> 00:12:17,909
You don't need that.

119
00:12:18,242 --> 00:12:20,495
I know, I had the surgery.
I'm just trying to protect us...

120
00:12:20,661 --> 00:12:22,288
and future usses and that's it.

121
00:12:22,455 --> 00:12:23,956
Just in case there's a monster in the closet.

122
00:12:24,123 --> 00:12:26,042
- Instead of, you know...
- Shirts.

123
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:29,170
You know me so well.

124
00:12:29,795 --> 00:12:31,964
- God.
- You finish all my sentences.

125
00:12:32,507 --> 00:12:34,383
You should have shirts in your closet.

126
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:35,760
Yeah.

127
00:12:36,594 --> 00:12:38,304
You know what there should be?
No more surprises.

128
00:12:38,471 --> 00:12:39,680
We're gonna have a nice dinner tonight.

129
00:12:39,847 --> 00:12:41,432
Show off this Harry Winston.

130
00:12:42,016 --> 00:12:44,352
Right? And we should have
no more surprises. Ever.

131
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:45,561
I should promise you.

132
00:12:45,728 --> 00:12:47,021
- Yes.
- I will.

133
00:12:49,482 --> 00:12:50,441
Thank you.

134
00:12:50,608 --> 00:12:51,776
Tony Stark.

135
00:12:51,943 --> 00:12:54,946
I'm Doctor Stephen Strange.
I need you to come with me.

136
00:12:57,573 --> 00:12:59,534
Congratulations on the wedding, by the way.

137
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,494
I'm sorry, you giving out
tickets to something?

138
00:13:01,661 --> 00:13:03,079
We need your help.

139
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:07,124
It's not overselling it to say that
the fate of the universe is at stake.

140
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:08,709
And who's "we"?

141
00:13:10,419 --> 00:13:11,504
Hey, Tony.

142
00:13:11,671 --> 00:13:12,672
Bruce.

143
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:14,465
- Pepper.
- Hi.

144
00:13:17,802 --> 00:13:19,095
You okay?

145
00:13:20,888 --> 00:13:24,100
At the dawn of the universe,
there was nothing.

146
00:13:24,267 --> 00:13:25,101
Then...

147
00:13:27,311 --> 00:13:30,648
The Big Bang sent six elemental crystals...

148
00:13:30,815 --> 00:13:33,651
hurtling across the virgin universe.

149
00:13:34,694 --> 00:13:39,240
These Infinity Stones each control
an essential aspect of existence.

150
00:13:40,199 --> 00:13:41,367
Space.

151
00:13:42,493 --> 00:13:43,661
Reality.

152
00:13:45,288 --> 00:13:46,455
Power.

153
00:13:47,665 --> 00:13:48,833
Soul.

154
00:13:49,959 --> 00:13:51,127
Mind.

155
00:13:53,045 --> 00:13:54,297
And Time.

156
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:05,057
Tell me his name again.

157
00:14:05,224 --> 00:14:06,434
Thanos.

158
00:14:06,601 --> 00:14:09,854
He's a plague, Tony. He invades planets.
He takes what he wants.

159
00:14:10,021 --> 00:14:12,148
He wipes out half the population.

160
00:14:12,315 --> 00:14:14,025
He sent Loki.

161
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:17,570
The attack on New York, that's him.

162
00:14:18,154 --> 00:14:19,280
This is it.

163
00:14:20,531 --> 00:14:21,365
What's our timeline?

164
00:14:21,532 --> 00:14:23,743
No telling. He has the Power
and Space Stones.

165
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:26,537
That already makes him the strongest
creature in the whole universe.

166
00:14:26,704 --> 00:14:29,957
If he gets his hands
on all six stones, Tony...

167
00:14:30,124 --> 00:14:33,336
He could destroy life
on a scale hitherto undreamt of.

168
00:14:33,503 --> 00:14:35,338
Did you seriously just say
"hitherto undreamt of"?

169
00:14:35,505 --> 00:14:37,548
Are you seriously leaning
on the Cauldron of the Cosmos?

170
00:14:37,715 --> 00:14:38,716
Is that what it is?

171
00:14:41,969 --> 00:14:43,888
I'm going to allow that.

172
00:14:46,098 --> 00:14:49,018
If Thanos needs all six, why don't we just
stick this one down a garbage disposal?

173
00:14:49,185 --> 00:14:50,186
No can do.

174
00:14:50,353 --> 00:14:53,064
We swore an oath to protect
the Time Stone with our lives.

175
00:14:53,231 --> 00:14:56,943
And I swore off dairy, but then Ben
& Jerry's named a flavor after me.

176
00:14:57,109 --> 00:14:58,569
- Stark Raving Hazelnuts.
- Not bad.

177
00:14:58,736 --> 00:15:00,112
A bit chalky.

178
00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:01,823
A Hunk of Hulk of Burning Fudge
is our favorite.

179
00:15:01,989 --> 00:15:04,367
- That's a thing?
- Whatever. Point is, things change.

180
00:15:04,534 --> 00:15:07,286
Our oath to protect the Time Stone
cannot change.

181
00:15:07,453 --> 00:15:09,497
And this stone may be the best chance
we have against Thanos.

182
00:15:09,664 --> 00:15:12,542
Yeah, so conversely, it may also be
his best chance against us.

183
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:14,085
Well, if we don't do our jobs.

184
00:15:14,252 --> 00:15:16,963
What is your job exactly?
Besides making balloon animals.

185
00:15:18,089 --> 00:15:20,633
Protecting your reality, douchebag.

186
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,302
Okay, guys. Could we table
this discussion right now?

187
00:15:23,469 --> 00:15:26,722
The fact is we have this stone.
We know where it is.

188
00:15:27,098 --> 00:15:31,310
Vision is out there somewhere with the
Mind Stone and we have to find him now.

189
00:15:32,103 --> 00:15:33,521
Yeah, that's the thing.

190
00:15:33,688 --> 00:15:34,564
What do you mean?

191
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:38,067
Two weeks ago, Vision turned off
his transponder. He's offline.

192
00:15:38,234 --> 00:15:39,485
- What?
- Yeah.

193
00:15:39,652 --> 00:15:41,571
Tony, you lost another super-bot?

194
00:15:41,737 --> 00:15:43,990
I didn't lose him.
He's more than that. He's evolving.

195
00:15:44,157 --> 00:15:45,616
Who could find Vision then?

196
00:15:48,619 --> 00:15:49,620
Shit.

197
00:15:50,288 --> 00:15:51,289
Probably Steve Rogers.

198
00:15:51,455 --> 00:15:52,623
Oh, great.

199
00:15:53,082 --> 00:15:54,292
Maybe.

200
00:15:54,917 --> 00:15:55,918
But...

201
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:00,506
Call him.

202
00:16:01,257 --> 00:16:02,550
It's not that easy.

203
00:16:03,634 --> 00:16:05,428
God, we haven't caught up in a spell,
have we?

204
00:16:05,595 --> 00:16:06,471
No.

205
00:16:06,637 --> 00:16:08,347
The Avengers broke up. We're toast.

206
00:16:08,973 --> 00:16:10,057
Broke up?

207
00:16:11,976 --> 00:16:13,853
Like a band? Like the Beatles?

208
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:15,938
Cap and I fell out hard.

209
00:16:16,939 --> 00:16:18,107
We're not on speaking terms.

210
00:16:19,567 --> 00:16:22,069
Tony, listen to me.

211
00:16:23,154 --> 00:16:24,489
Thor's gone.

212
00:16:26,199 --> 00:16:29,076
Thanos is coming. It doesn't matter
who you're talking to or not.

213
00:16:46,344 --> 00:16:47,345
Flip phone.

214
00:17:08,449 --> 00:17:10,910
Say, Doc, you wouldn't happen to be
moving your hair, would ya?

215
00:17:11,869 --> 00:17:14,080
Not at the moment, no.

216
00:17:46,779 --> 00:17:48,072
You okay?

217
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:50,741
- Help him!
- Banner!

218
00:17:50,908 --> 00:17:52,493
- Wong! Look alive!
- Go, go! We got it!

219
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:53,619
Friday, what am I looking at?

220
00:17:53,786 --> 00:17:55,121
Not sure. I'm working on it.

221
00:17:55,288 --> 00:17:58,624
Hey! You might wanna put that Time Stone
in your back pocket, Doc!

222
00:17:58,791 --> 00:18:00,001
Might wanna use it.

223
00:18:27,445 --> 00:18:29,739
Ned, hey. I need you to cause a distraction.

224
00:18:29,906 --> 00:18:31,199
Holy shit.

225
00:18:31,574 --> 00:18:33,034
We're all gonna die!

226
00:18:33,201 --> 00:18:34,410
There's a spaceship!

227
00:18:34,577 --> 00:18:36,287
- What's going on?
- Oh, my God!

228
00:18:44,837 --> 00:18:47,799
What's the matter with you kids?
You never seen a spaceship before?

229
00:19:00,061 --> 00:19:03,481
Friday, evac anyone south of 43rd Street.
Notify first responders.

230
00:19:03,648 --> 00:19:04,816
Will do.

231
00:19:33,177 --> 00:19:36,097
Hear me and rejoice.

232
00:19:37,473 --> 00:19:41,060
You are about to die
at the hands of the Children of Thanos.

233
00:19:42,186 --> 00:19:46,399
Be thankful that your meaningless
lives are now contributing...

234
00:19:46,774 --> 00:19:49,527
I'm sorry, Earth is closed today.

235
00:19:49,694 --> 00:19:52,405
You better pack it up and get outta here.

236
00:19:52,572 --> 00:19:53,698
Stonekeeper.

237
00:19:54,657 --> 00:19:56,909
Does this chattering animal speak for you?

238
00:19:57,076 --> 00:19:58,870
Certainly not. I speak for myself.

239
00:19:59,328 --> 00:20:01,747
You're trespassing in this city
and on this planet.

240
00:20:02,748 --> 00:20:04,208
He means get lost, Squidward.

241
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:05,543
He exhausts me.

242
00:20:06,419 --> 00:20:07,670
Bring me the stone.

243
00:20:09,297 --> 00:20:10,756
Banner, you want a piece?

244
00:20:12,008 --> 00:20:14,510
No, not really. But when
do I ever get what I want?

245
00:20:14,677 --> 00:20:15,678
That's right.

246
00:20:16,387 --> 00:20:17,597
Okay. Push!

247
00:20:17,763 --> 00:20:19,223
It's been a while.

248
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:20,892
It's gonna be good to have you, buddy.

249
00:20:21,058 --> 00:20:21,976
Okay.

250
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:24,896
Let me just...
I need to concentrate here for a second.

251
00:20:25,062 --> 00:20:26,355
Come on, come on, man.

252
00:20:27,857 --> 00:20:28,691
God!

253
00:20:29,817 --> 00:20:31,068
Where's your guy?

254
00:20:32,487 --> 00:20:33,863
I don't know.
We've sorta been having a thing.

255
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:35,072
- It's no time for a thing.
- I know.

256
00:20:35,239 --> 00:20:36,699
That's the thing right there. Let's go.

257
00:20:43,915 --> 00:20:45,082
Dude, you're embarrassing me
in front of the wizards.

258
00:20:45,249 --> 00:20:47,168
Tony, I'm sorry. Either I can't or he won't.

259
00:20:47,335 --> 00:20:48,169
It's okay.

260
00:20:48,336 --> 00:20:50,713
Hey, stand down.
Keep an eye on him. Thank you.

261
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,215
- I have him.
- Damn it.

262
00:21:19,909 --> 00:21:21,077
Where'd that come from?

263
00:21:21,244 --> 00:21:23,412
It's nanotech. You like it?
A little something I...

264
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:30,711
Doctor Banner, if the rest of
your green friend won't be joining us...

265
00:21:40,346 --> 00:21:41,639
Gotta get that stone outta here, now.

266
00:21:41,806 --> 00:21:43,099
It stays with me.

267
00:21:43,266 --> 00:21:44,100
Exactly. Bye.

268
00:21:53,943 --> 00:21:55,153
Tony, you okay?

269
00:21:55,319 --> 00:21:56,445
How we doing? Good? Bad?

270
00:21:56,612 --> 00:21:58,489
Really, really good. Really good.
Do you plan on helping out?

271
00:21:58,656 --> 00:21:59,949
I'm trying. He won't come out.

272
00:22:01,826 --> 00:22:02,910
Hammer.

273
00:22:10,668 --> 00:22:13,546
Come on, Hulk! What are you doing to me?

274
00:22:13,713 --> 00:22:15,840
Come out! Come out! Come out!

275
00:22:16,007 --> 00:22:18,217
No!

276
00:22:22,096 --> 00:22:23,890
What do you mean, "no"?

277
00:22:29,645 --> 00:22:31,272
Hey, man. What's up, Mr. Stark?

278
00:22:31,439 --> 00:22:34,233
- Kid, where'd you come from?
- A field trip to MoMA.

279
00:22:36,277 --> 00:22:37,737
What is this guy's problem, Mr. Stark?

280
00:22:39,155 --> 00:22:41,949
He's from space. He came here
to steal a necklace from a wizard.

281
00:23:08,601 --> 00:23:12,271
Your powers are quaint.
You must be popular with children.

282
00:23:15,233 --> 00:23:17,026
It's a simple spell but quite unbreakable.

283
00:23:17,193 --> 00:23:19,153
Then I'll take it off your corpse.

284
00:23:32,208 --> 00:23:37,296
You'll find removing
a dead man's spell troublesome.

285
00:23:37,463 --> 00:23:39,132
You'll only wish you were dead.

286
00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:50,393
No!

287
00:23:54,564 --> 00:23:56,065
Kid, that's the wizard. Get on it.

288
00:23:56,232 --> 00:23:57,775
On it!

289
00:24:05,491 --> 00:24:06,576
Not cool.

290
00:24:10,997 --> 00:24:11,831
Gotcha!

291
00:24:13,332 --> 00:24:14,041
Wait!

292
00:24:21,966 --> 00:24:24,677
Mr. Stark, I'm being beamed up.

293
00:24:24,844 --> 00:24:26,137
Hang on, kid.

294
00:24:46,073 --> 00:24:47,825
Wong, you're invited to my wedding.

295
00:24:55,374 --> 00:24:56,501
Give me a little juice, Friday.

296
00:25:05,426 --> 00:25:06,844
Unlock 17:A.

297
00:25:19,857 --> 00:25:21,484
Pete, you gotta let go. I'm gonna catch you.

298
00:25:21,651 --> 00:25:23,694
But you said save the wizard!

299
00:25:24,111 --> 00:25:25,112
I can't breathe.

300
00:25:26,405 --> 00:25:28,074
We're too high up. You're running out of air.

301
00:25:29,033 --> 00:25:31,285
Yeah. That makes sense.

302
00:25:48,469 --> 00:25:50,471
Mr. Stark, it smells like a new car in here!

303
00:25:50,638 --> 00:25:51,597
Happy trails, kid.

304
00:25:51,764 --> 00:25:53,182
- Friday, send him home.
- Yep.

305
00:25:54,142 --> 00:25:55,601
Oh, come on!

306
00:26:04,026 --> 00:26:06,028
Boss, incoming call from Miss Potts.

307
00:26:06,195 --> 00:26:08,281
Tony? Oh, my God.
Are you all right? What's going on?

308
00:26:08,447 --> 00:26:11,117
Yeah, I'm fine. I just think we might
have to push our 8:30 res.

309
00:26:11,284 --> 00:26:12,201
Why?

310
00:26:12,368 --> 00:26:15,371
Just 'cause I'll probably not
make it back for a while.

311
00:26:16,455 --> 00:26:17,707
Tell me you're not on that ship.

312
00:26:17,874 --> 00:26:18,708
Yeah.

313
00:26:18,875 --> 00:26:20,209
God, no, please tell me
you're not on the ship.

314
00:26:20,376 --> 00:26:21,961
Honey, I'm sorry.

315
00:26:22,128 --> 00:26:24,630
- I'm sorry, I don't know what to say.
- Come back here, Tony. I swear to God.

316
00:26:24,797 --> 00:26:26,841
- Pep.
- Come back here right now.

317
00:26:27,008 --> 00:26:28,009
Come back.

318
00:26:28,176 --> 00:26:30,094
Boss, we're losing her.

319
00:26:30,761 --> 00:26:32,305
I'm going too.

320
00:26:41,397 --> 00:26:42,648
Oh, my God!

321
00:26:47,111 --> 00:26:49,071
I shoulda stayed on the bus.

322
00:27:03,419 --> 00:27:04,795
Where you going?

323
00:27:05,087 --> 00:27:06,464
The Time Stone's been taken.

324
00:27:06,631 --> 00:27:08,549
The Sanctum remains unguarded.

325
00:27:09,133 --> 00:27:10,635
What will you do?

326
00:27:11,427 --> 00:27:13,095
I'm gonna make a call.

327
00:27:53,386 --> 00:27:54,554
Sing it, Drax!

328
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:08,526
Why are we doing this again?

329
00:28:08,693 --> 00:28:11,404
It's a distress signal, Rocket.
Someone could be dying.

330
00:28:11,571 --> 00:28:13,656
I get that, but why are we doing it?

331
00:28:13,823 --> 00:28:15,616
'Cause we're nice.

332
00:28:15,783 --> 00:28:18,536
And maybe whoever it is will give us
a little cheddar cheese for our effort.

333
00:28:18,703 --> 00:28:21,038
- Which isn't the point.
- Which isn't the point.

334
00:28:21,205 --> 00:28:22,915
I mean, if he doesn't pony up...

335
00:28:23,082 --> 00:28:24,125
We take his ship.

336
00:28:24,292 --> 00:28:25,960
- Exactly!
- Bingo!

337
00:28:26,127 --> 00:28:26,878
All right!

338
00:28:30,339 --> 00:28:31,799
We are arriving.

339
00:28:32,216 --> 00:28:34,427
All right, Guardians,
don't forget this might be dangerous...

340
00:28:34,594 --> 00:28:36,888
so let's put on our mean faces.

341
00:28:42,143 --> 00:28:44,770
Groot, put that thing away, now.
I don't wanna tell you again.

342
00:28:45,146 --> 00:28:45,980
Groot.

343
00:28:46,147 --> 00:28:47,273
I am Groot!

344
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,316
- Whoa!
- Language!

345
00:28:48,483 --> 00:28:49,817
- Hey!
- Wow.

346
00:28:49,984 --> 00:28:51,652
You got some acorns on you, kid.

347
00:28:51,819 --> 00:28:54,447
Ever since you got a little sap,
you're a total d-hole.

348
00:28:55,406 --> 00:28:58,659
Now, keep it up, and I'm gonna smash
that thing to pieces.

349
00:29:05,583 --> 00:29:07,126
What happened?

350
00:29:11,172 --> 00:29:12,507
Oh, my God.

351
00:29:18,095 --> 00:29:19,847
Looks like we're not getting paid.

352
00:29:22,099 --> 00:29:24,060
Wipers! Wipers!

353
00:29:24,227 --> 00:29:25,520
Get it off.

354
00:29:32,193 --> 00:29:34,946
How the hell is this dude still alive?

355
00:29:35,112 --> 00:29:36,906
He is not a dude.

356
00:29:37,073 --> 00:29:38,616
You're a dude.

357
00:29:40,201 --> 00:29:41,994
This is a man.

358
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:45,122
A handsome, muscular man.

359
00:29:45,289 --> 00:29:46,207
I'm muscular.

360
00:29:46,374 --> 00:29:48,835
But who are you kidding, Quill?
You're one sandwich away from fat.

361
00:29:49,001 --> 00:29:49,836
Yeah, right.

362
00:29:50,002 --> 00:29:52,421
- It's true, Quill. You have put on weight.
- What?

363
00:29:54,841 --> 00:29:56,717
Gamora, do you think I'm...

364
00:29:59,011 --> 00:30:02,598
He is anxious, angry.

365
00:30:02,765 --> 00:30:05,643
He feels tremendous loss and guilt.

366
00:30:06,519 --> 00:30:09,272
It's like a pirate had a baby with an angel.

367
00:30:09,438 --> 00:30:10,356
Wow.

368
00:30:10,523 --> 00:30:12,400
This is a real wake-up call for me. Okay.

369
00:30:12,567 --> 00:30:16,404
I'm gonna get a Bowflex. I'm gonna commit.
I'm gonna get some dumbbells.

370
00:30:16,571 --> 00:30:17,905
You know you can't eat dumbbells, right?

371
00:30:18,072 --> 00:30:21,284
It's like his muscles
are made of Cotati metal fibers.

372
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:23,161
Stop massaging his muscles.

373
00:30:25,121 --> 00:30:25,955
Wake him up.

374
00:30:29,041 --> 00:30:30,042
Wake.

375
00:30:47,643 --> 00:30:49,896
Who the hell are you guys?

376
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:56,319
The entire time I knew Thanos,
he only ever had one goal.

377
00:30:56,486 --> 00:31:00,448
To bring balance to the universe
by wiping out half of all life.

378
00:31:01,365 --> 00:31:05,036
He used to kill people
planet by planet, massacre by massacre.

379
00:31:05,328 --> 00:31:06,704
Including my own.

380
00:31:06,871 --> 00:31:08,456
If he gets all six Infinity Stones...

381
00:31:08,623 --> 00:31:10,833
he can do it
with the snap of his fingers like this.

382
00:31:11,834 --> 00:31:14,420
You seem to know a great deal about Thanos.

383
00:31:14,587 --> 00:31:18,382
Gamora is the daughter of Thanos.

384
00:31:22,428 --> 00:31:24,514
Your father killed my brother.

385
00:31:24,847 --> 00:31:26,057
Oh, boy.

386
00:31:26,224 --> 00:31:27,892
Stepfather, technically.

387
00:31:28,059 --> 00:31:29,977
And she hates him as much as you do.

388
00:31:33,689 --> 00:31:35,233
Families can be tough.

389
00:31:35,399 --> 00:31:38,569
Before my father died, he told me
that I had a half-sister...

390
00:31:38,736 --> 00:31:40,988
that he imprisoned in Hel.

391
00:31:41,155 --> 00:31:44,116
And then she returned home
and stabbed me in the eye.

392
00:31:44,283 --> 00:31:45,576
So I had to kill her.

393
00:31:45,743 --> 00:31:49,121
That's life though, isn't it, I guess.
Goes round and round and...

394
00:31:49,956 --> 00:31:50,957
I feel your pain.

395
00:31:51,123 --> 00:31:53,417
I feel your pain as well, because...

396
00:31:53,584 --> 00:31:55,962
I mean, it's not a competition,
but I've been through a lot.

397
00:31:56,128 --> 00:31:57,797
My father killed my mother.

398
00:31:57,964 --> 00:32:00,675
And then I had to kill my father.
That was hard.

399
00:32:00,842 --> 00:32:03,719
Probably even harder
than having to kill a sister.

400
00:32:04,262 --> 00:32:07,140
Plus, I came out with both my eyes,
which was...

401
00:32:07,306 --> 00:32:09,016
I need a hammer, not a spoon.

402
00:32:10,852 --> 00:32:13,938
How do I open this thing?
Is there some sort of...

403
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:17,024
A four-digit code, maybe? Maybe a birthdate.

404
00:32:18,109 --> 00:32:20,486
- What are you doing?
- Taking your pod.

405
00:32:21,946 --> 00:32:22,989
No, you're not.

406
00:32:25,116 --> 00:32:28,995
You will not be taking our pod today, sir.

407
00:32:30,663 --> 00:32:32,874
Quill, are you making your voice deeper?

408
00:32:34,792 --> 00:32:36,419
- No.
- You are.

409
00:32:36,586 --> 00:32:39,297
You're imitating the god-man. It's weird.

410
00:32:39,464 --> 00:32:40,631
No, I'm not.

411
00:32:40,798 --> 00:32:42,842
- He just did it again!
- This is my voice.

412
00:32:49,015 --> 00:32:50,016
Are you mocking me?

413
00:32:50,475 --> 00:32:53,394
- Are you mocking me?
- Stop it. You did it again.

414
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:55,980
- He's trying to copy me.
- I need you to stop doing that.

415
00:32:56,147 --> 00:32:57,773
- Enough!
- He's doing it first.

416
00:32:57,940 --> 00:32:59,317
We need to stop Thanos.

417
00:32:59,484 --> 00:33:02,111
Which means we need to find out
where he's going next.

418
00:33:02,278 --> 00:33:03,529
Knowhere.

419
00:33:03,696 --> 00:33:05,364
He must be going somewhere.

420
00:33:05,531 --> 00:33:07,533
No, no. Knowhere?

421
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:10,369
It's a place. We've been there. It sucks.

422
00:33:10,536 --> 00:33:12,955
- Excuse me, that's our food.
- Not anymore.

423
00:33:13,372 --> 00:33:16,542
Thor, why would he go to Knowhere?

424
00:33:16,709 --> 00:33:17,877
Because for years...

425
00:33:18,044 --> 00:33:21,714
the Reality Stone's been safely stored
there with a man called the Collector.

426
00:33:21,881 --> 00:33:23,466
If it's with the Collector,
then it's not safe.

427
00:33:23,633 --> 00:33:25,343
Only an idiot would give that man a stone.

428
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:26,886
- Or a genius.
- How do you know...

429
00:33:27,053 --> 00:33:29,597
he's not going for one of the other stones?

430
00:33:29,764 --> 00:33:32,141
There are six stones out there.

431
00:33:32,308 --> 00:33:34,519
Thanos already has the Power Stone...

432
00:33:34,685 --> 00:33:37,980
because he stole it last week
when he decimated Xandar.

433
00:33:38,439 --> 00:33:40,483
He stole the Space Stone from me...

434
00:33:40,650 --> 00:33:43,319
when he destroyed my ship
and slaughtered half my people.

435
00:33:43,486 --> 00:33:46,197
The Time and Mind Stones are safe on Earth.
They're with the Avengers.

436
00:33:46,531 --> 00:33:48,783
- The Avengers?
- Earth's mightiest heroes.

437
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:50,076
Like Kevin Bacon?

438
00:33:50,243 --> 00:33:52,620
He may be on the team. I don't know.
I haven't been there in a while.

439
00:33:52,787 --> 00:33:54,997
As for the Soul Stone, well,
no one's ever seen that.

440
00:33:55,164 --> 00:33:56,791
No one even knows where it is.

441
00:33:56,958 --> 00:34:00,253
Therefore Thanos can't get it.
Therefore he's going to Knowhere.

442
00:34:00,419 --> 00:34:02,839
Hence he'll be getting the Reality Stone.

443
00:34:03,005 --> 00:34:04,048
You're welcome.

444
00:34:04,215 --> 00:34:05,383
Then we have to go to Knowhere now.

445
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:09,262
Wrong. Where we have to go is Nidavellir.

446
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:11,556
- That's a made-up word.
- All words are made up.

447
00:34:11,722 --> 00:34:14,809
Nidavellir is real? Seriously?

448
00:34:14,976 --> 00:34:16,602
That place is a legend.

449
00:34:16,769 --> 00:34:20,314
They make the most powerful, horrific
weapons to ever torment the universe.

450
00:34:20,481 --> 00:34:22,525
I would very much like to go there, please.

451
00:34:22,692 --> 00:34:24,735
The rabbit is correct and clearly
the smartest among you.

452
00:34:24,902 --> 00:34:25,945
Rabbit?

453
00:34:26,112 --> 00:34:28,364
Only Eitri the Dwarf can make me
the weapon I need.

454
00:34:28,531 --> 00:34:29,740
I assume you're the captain, sir.

455
00:34:29,907 --> 00:34:30,908
You're very perceptive.

456
00:34:31,075 --> 00:34:33,953
You seem like a noble leader.
Will you join me on my quest to Nidavellir?

457
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:36,914
Let me just ask the captain.
Oh, wait a second, it's me!

458
00:34:37,081 --> 00:34:38,833
- Yeah. I'll go.
- Wonderful!

459
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,002
- Except for that I'm the captain.
- Quiet.

460
00:34:41,169 --> 00:34:42,879
- That's my backpack.
- Go sit down.

461
00:34:43,045 --> 00:34:44,672
Look, this is my ship.

462
00:34:44,839 --> 00:34:46,591
And I'm not goin' to...

463
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:49,677
Wait, what kinda weapon
are we talkin' about here?

464
00:34:49,844 --> 00:34:51,095
The Thanos-killing kind.

465
00:34:51,929 --> 00:34:53,431
Don't you think that we should all
have a weapon like that?

466
00:34:53,598 --> 00:34:55,641
No. You simply lack
the strength to wield them.

467
00:34:55,808 --> 00:34:58,144
Your bodies would crumble
as your minds collapsed into madness.

468
00:34:58,311 --> 00:35:00,229
Is it weird that I wanna do it even more now?

469
00:35:00,396 --> 00:35:01,564
A little bit, yeah.

470
00:35:01,731 --> 00:35:04,650
If we don't go to Knowhere
and Thanos retrieves another stone...

471
00:35:04,817 --> 00:35:06,360
he'll be too powerful to stop.

472
00:35:06,527 --> 00:35:08,696
- He already is.
- I got it figured out.

473
00:35:08,863 --> 00:35:12,033
We got two ships
and a large assortment of morons.

474
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:15,453
So me and Groot will go
with the pirate angel here.

475
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:18,456
And the morons will go to Knowhere
to try to stop Thanos.

476
00:35:18,623 --> 00:35:20,541
- Cool? Cool.
- So cool.

477
00:35:20,708 --> 00:35:22,001
For the record...

478
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:25,254
I know that you're going with him
because it's where Thanos isn't.

479
00:35:25,421 --> 00:35:29,133
You know, you really shouldn't
talk that way to your captain, Quill.

480
00:35:30,092 --> 00:35:31,427
Come on, Groot.

481
00:35:31,969 --> 00:35:34,680
Put that game down. You'll rot your brain.

482
00:35:38,392 --> 00:35:41,229
I bid you farewell and good luck, morons.

483
00:35:41,395 --> 00:35:42,522
Bye.

484
00:35:57,370 --> 00:35:58,496
Vis?

485
00:35:58,955 --> 00:36:00,873
Is it the stone again?

486
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,667
It's as if it's speaking to me.

487
00:36:03,292 --> 00:36:05,002
What does it say?

488
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:08,256
I don't know, but something.

489
00:36:10,633 --> 00:36:11,717
Hey.

490
00:36:21,561 --> 00:36:24,063
Tell me what you feel.

491
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:33,781
I just feel you.

492
00:36:42,248 --> 00:36:43,875
So there's a 10:00 a.m. to Glasgow...

493
00:36:44,041 --> 00:36:46,043
which would give us more time together
before you went back.

494
00:36:46,210 --> 00:36:47,670
What if I miss that train?

495
00:36:47,837 --> 00:36:48,838
There's an 11:00.

496
00:36:49,005 --> 00:36:51,424
What if I missed all the trains?

497
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,510
What if this time I didn't go back?

498
00:36:54,677 --> 00:36:56,012
But you gave Stark your word.

499
00:36:56,179 --> 00:36:57,346
I'd rather give it to you.

500
00:36:57,513 --> 00:36:59,474
Well, there are people
who are expecting me too, you know.

501
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,975
We both made promises.

502
00:37:01,142 --> 00:37:02,852
Not to each other.

503
00:37:03,436 --> 00:37:04,270
Wanda.

504
00:37:05,229 --> 00:37:07,565
For two years, we've stolen these moments...

505
00:37:07,732 --> 00:37:09,775
trying to see if this could work and...

506
00:37:09,942 --> 00:37:11,527
I don't know.

507
00:37:11,694 --> 00:37:13,654
You know what,
I'm just gonna speak for myself.

508
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:15,531
I think...

509
00:37:15,698 --> 00:37:16,782
- It works.
- It works.

510
00:37:16,949 --> 00:37:18,242
It works.

511
00:37:20,703 --> 00:37:21,954
Stay.

512
00:37:22,872 --> 00:37:24,540
Stay with me.

513
00:37:29,295 --> 00:37:32,548
Or not. If I'm overstepping...

514
00:37:39,597 --> 00:37:41,349
What are they?

515
00:37:41,682 --> 00:37:44,101
What the stone was warning me about.

516
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:55,404
I have to go.

517
00:37:55,571 --> 00:37:56,489
No, Vision.

518
00:37:57,114 --> 00:38:01,244
Vision, if that's true,
then maybe going isn't the best idea.

519
00:38:02,286 --> 00:38:03,329
Wanda, I...

520
00:38:03,496 --> 00:38:04,247
Vision!

521
00:38:33,734 --> 00:38:36,404
The blade, it stopped me from phasing.

522
00:38:37,321 --> 00:38:39,282
- Is that even possible?
- It isn't supposed to be.

523
00:38:40,366 --> 00:38:42,076
My systems are failing.

524
00:38:42,994 --> 00:38:45,663
I'm beginning to think
we should have stayed in bed.

525
00:38:48,207 --> 00:38:48,833
Vis!

526
00:38:58,301 --> 00:39:01,679
Give up the stone, and she lives.

527
00:39:39,801 --> 00:39:41,010
Hands off.

528
00:39:56,818 --> 00:39:58,069
Come on. Come on.

529
00:39:58,236 --> 00:40:00,029
Come on, you gotta get up.

530
00:40:00,196 --> 00:40:02,406
You gotta get up. Come on. Hey.

531
00:40:03,491 --> 00:40:04,909
Hey. We have to go.

532
00:40:06,828 --> 00:40:09,372
Please. Please leave.

533
00:40:09,539 --> 00:40:11,332
You asked me to stay.

534
00:40:12,583 --> 00:40:13,751
- I'm staying.
- Please.

535
00:41:24,947 --> 00:41:26,657
- Get up.
- I can't.

536
00:41:26,824 --> 00:41:29,535
We don't wanna kill you, but we will.

537
00:41:29,702 --> 00:41:31,871
You'll never get the chance again.

538
00:41:47,845 --> 00:41:49,388
Can you stand?

539
00:41:54,143 --> 00:41:55,561
Thank you, Captain.

540
00:41:58,272 --> 00:41:59,899
Let's get you on the jet.

541
00:42:03,861 --> 00:42:07,281
Now, I thought we had a deal.

542
00:42:07,448 --> 00:42:11,160
Stay close, check in, don't take any chances.

543
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:12,662
I'm sorry.

544
00:42:12,829 --> 00:42:14,622
We just wanted time.

545
00:42:17,333 --> 00:42:18,584
Where to, Cap?

546
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:22,922
Home.

547
00:42:26,509 --> 00:42:28,553
We'll be safe. We'll be safe.

548
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:54,162
Zehobereians.

549
00:42:54,328 --> 00:42:56,038
Mother! Where's my mother?

550
00:42:56,205 --> 00:42:57,582
Choose a side or die.

551
00:42:57,748 --> 00:42:59,208
Mother!

552
00:42:59,375 --> 00:43:01,544
One side is a revelation...

553
00:43:01,711 --> 00:43:04,755
the other an honor known only to a few.

554
00:43:05,673 --> 00:43:07,133
What's wrong, little one?

555
00:43:07,758 --> 00:43:11,179
My mother. Where is my mother?

556
00:43:15,975 --> 00:43:17,185
What's your name?

557
00:43:18,519 --> 00:43:20,188
Gamora.

558
00:43:20,688 --> 00:43:22,815
You're quite the fighter, Gamora.

559
00:43:24,358 --> 00:43:25,359
Come.

560
00:43:25,735 --> 00:43:26,736
Let me help you.

561
00:43:40,249 --> 00:43:41,375
Look.

562
00:43:45,046 --> 00:43:46,714
Pretty, isn't it?

563
00:43:47,465 --> 00:43:50,927
Perfectly balanced, as all things should be.

564
00:43:51,093 --> 00:43:54,847
Too much to one side or the other...

565
00:43:58,851 --> 00:44:01,687
Here. You try.

566
00:44:05,441 --> 00:44:08,528
Now, go in peace to meet your maker.

567
00:44:13,783 --> 00:44:15,326
Concentrate.

568
00:44:18,287 --> 00:44:21,082
There. You've got it.

569
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:31,676
Gamora.

570
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:36,097
Do you know if these grenades are the
blow-off-your-junk kind or the gas kind?

571
00:44:36,264 --> 00:44:39,016
Because I was thinking about
hanging a couple on my belt right here.

572
00:44:39,183 --> 00:44:41,519
- But I don't want to if they're the...
- I need to ask a favor.

573
00:44:42,436 --> 00:44:43,771
Yeah, sure.

574
00:44:45,314 --> 00:44:48,734
One way or another,
the path that we're on leads to Thanos.

575
00:44:50,486 --> 00:44:51,988
Which is what the grenades are for.

576
00:44:53,531 --> 00:44:55,241
I'm sorry. What's the favor?

577
00:44:57,577 --> 00:44:58,578
If things go wrong...

578
00:45:00,163 --> 00:45:02,331
If Thanos gets me...

579
00:45:06,878 --> 00:45:08,838
I want you to promise me...

580
00:45:09,881 --> 00:45:11,007
you'll kill me.

581
00:45:11,841 --> 00:45:12,758
What?

582
00:45:15,928 --> 00:45:18,306
I know something he doesn't.

583
00:45:20,850 --> 00:45:24,520
And if he finds it out,
the entire universe could be at risk.

584
00:45:25,188 --> 00:45:26,272
What do you know?

585
00:45:26,439 --> 00:45:28,483
If I tell you, you'd know too.

586
00:45:31,527 --> 00:45:33,362
If it's so important...

587
00:45:33,529 --> 00:45:34,489
shouldn't I?

588
00:45:34,655 --> 00:45:35,865
Only if you wanna die.

589
00:45:36,032 --> 00:45:37,617
Why does somebody always
have to die in this scenario?

590
00:45:39,035 --> 00:45:40,036
Just...

591
00:45:42,455 --> 00:45:45,458
Trust me. And possibly kill me.

592
00:45:45,625 --> 00:45:47,960
I mean, I'd like to.

593
00:45:48,127 --> 00:45:49,962
I really would. But you...

594
00:45:50,129 --> 00:45:51,339
Swear to me.

595
00:45:54,842 --> 00:45:57,136
Swear to me on your mother.

596
00:46:04,310 --> 00:46:05,144
Okay.

597
00:46:11,234 --> 00:46:12,360
Okay.

598
00:46:29,043 --> 00:46:31,337
Dude. How long have you been standing there?

599
00:46:31,504 --> 00:46:32,338
An hour.

600
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:34,132
An hour?

601
00:46:34,674 --> 00:46:35,967
Are you serious?

602
00:46:36,134 --> 00:46:41,055
I've mastered the ability of standing
so incredibly still...

603
00:46:42,265 --> 00:46:44,851
that I become invisible to the eye.

604
00:46:45,476 --> 00:46:46,477
Watch.

605
00:46:50,398 --> 00:46:51,983
You're eating a zarg-nut.

606
00:46:52,441 --> 00:46:53,860
But my movement...

607
00:46:54,694 --> 00:46:56,320
was so slow...

608
00:46:57,155 --> 00:46:58,990
that it's imperceptible.

609
00:46:59,157 --> 00:47:00,158
No.

610
00:47:01,576 --> 00:47:02,577
I'm sure I'm invisible.

611
00:47:02,743 --> 00:47:03,911
Hi, Drax.

612
00:47:06,622 --> 00:47:07,623
Damn it.

613
00:47:27,602 --> 00:47:29,353
This place looks deserted.

614
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:32,273
I'm reading movement in the third quadrant.

615
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:34,358
Yep, I'm picking that up too.

616
00:47:35,776 --> 00:47:37,236
Let's put down right here.

617
00:47:48,998 --> 00:47:50,541
I don't have it.

618
00:47:52,668 --> 00:47:55,880
Everyone in the galaxy knows
you'd sell your own brother...

619
00:47:56,047 --> 00:47:59,759
if you thought it would add even the slightest
trinket to your pathetic collection.

620
00:48:07,558 --> 00:48:09,977
I know you have the Reality Stone, Tivan.

621
00:48:10,937 --> 00:48:14,398
Giving it to me will spare you
a great deal of suffering.

622
00:48:17,652 --> 00:48:19,237
I told you.

623
00:48:20,029 --> 00:48:21,030
I sold it.

624
00:48:23,908 --> 00:48:25,910
Why would I lie?

625
00:48:26,077 --> 00:48:28,287
I imagine it's like breathing for you.

626
00:48:29,121 --> 00:48:30,832
Like suicide.

627
00:48:30,998 --> 00:48:32,500
You do understand.

628
00:48:33,459 --> 00:48:36,462
Not even you would surrender
something so precious.

629
00:48:36,629 --> 00:48:38,005
I didn't know what it was.

630
00:48:38,381 --> 00:48:40,967
Then you're more of a fool
than I took you for.

631
00:48:41,342 --> 00:48:42,343
It's him.

632
00:48:42,510 --> 00:48:43,970
Last chance, charlatan.

633
00:48:45,513 --> 00:48:47,473
Where's the stone?

634
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:48,641
Today...

635
00:48:49,183 --> 00:48:50,059
Drax. Drax.

636
00:48:50,226 --> 00:48:52,186
...he pays for the deaths
of my wife and daughter.

637
00:48:52,353 --> 00:48:53,312
Drax, wait.

638
00:48:54,814 --> 00:48:56,190
Not yet, not yet, not yet.

639
00:48:56,357 --> 00:48:57,567
Drax.

640
00:49:01,487 --> 00:49:03,739
Drax, Drax, Drax. Listen to me.

641
00:49:03,906 --> 00:49:06,159
He doesn't have the stone yet.

642
00:49:06,325 --> 00:49:07,952
If we get it, then we can stop him.

643
00:49:08,786 --> 00:49:11,956
We have to get the stone first. Yeah.

644
00:49:12,123 --> 00:49:13,207
No.

645
00:49:13,374 --> 00:49:16,419
No. For Ovette, for Camaria.

646
00:49:16,878 --> 00:49:18,171
Sleep.

647
00:49:30,099 --> 00:49:31,100
Okay.

648
00:49:31,267 --> 00:49:35,354
Gamora, Mantis, you go right.

649
00:49:36,731 --> 00:49:37,982
The other right.

650
00:50:02,298 --> 00:50:04,008
Why?

651
00:50:14,018 --> 00:50:18,064
Why you, daughter?

652
00:50:36,707 --> 00:50:37,708
That was quick.

653
00:50:43,506 --> 00:50:48,386
Magnificent! Magnificent! Magnificent!

654
00:50:50,721 --> 00:50:53,432
Is that sadness I sense in you, daughter?

655
00:50:56,561 --> 00:50:59,063
In my heart, I knew you still cared.

656
00:51:06,445 --> 00:51:09,699
But one never knows for sure.

657
00:51:18,916 --> 00:51:21,752
Reality is often disappointing.

658
00:51:24,922 --> 00:51:27,175
That is, it was.

659
00:51:29,218 --> 00:51:30,595
Now...

660
00:51:32,597 --> 00:51:35,391
reality can be whatever I want.

661
00:51:36,934 --> 00:51:38,394
You knew I'd come.

662
00:51:38,561 --> 00:51:40,188
I counted on it.

663
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:43,900
There's something we need to discuss,
little one.

664
00:51:48,529 --> 00:51:50,239
Thanos!

665
00:51:57,830 --> 00:51:58,873
No!

666
00:52:03,252 --> 00:52:04,837
Let her go, Grimace.

667
00:52:05,463 --> 00:52:06,297
Peter.

668
00:52:07,757 --> 00:52:09,008
I told you to go right.

669
00:52:09,592 --> 00:52:10,968
Now? Really?

670
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:12,553
You let her go!

671
00:52:13,596 --> 00:52:14,680
The boyfriend.

672
00:52:14,847 --> 00:52:15,848
No.

673
00:52:16,015 --> 00:52:19,727
Like to think of myself more as
a Titan-killing, long-term booty call.

674
00:52:19,894 --> 00:52:21,938
- Let her go.
- Peter.

675
00:52:22,104 --> 00:52:26,818
I'm gonna blow that nutsack of a chin
right off your face.

676
00:52:27,401 --> 00:52:28,903
Not him.

677
00:52:39,372 --> 00:52:43,084
You promised. You promised.

678
00:52:47,255 --> 00:52:48,464
Oh, daughter.

679
00:52:48,923 --> 00:52:51,425
You expect too much from him.

680
00:52:55,012 --> 00:52:56,597
She's asked, hasn't she?

681
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:01,561
Do it.

682
00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:09,318
Do it!

683
00:53:16,075 --> 00:53:17,493
I told you to go right.

684
00:53:19,453 --> 00:53:22,415
I love you more than anything.

685
00:53:25,543 --> 00:53:27,044
I love you too.

686
00:53:41,350 --> 00:53:42,393
I like him.

687
00:54:13,007 --> 00:54:15,009
Still no word from Vision?

688
00:54:15,176 --> 00:54:17,804
Satellites lost him somewhere over Edinburgh.

689
00:54:18,429 --> 00:54:21,349
On a stolen Quinjet with four
of the world's most wanted criminals.

690
00:54:21,808 --> 00:54:23,287
You know they're only criminals because

691
00:54:23,299 --> 00:54:24,977
you've chosen to call them that, right, sir?

692
00:54:25,144 --> 00:54:26,270
My God, Rhodes.

693
00:54:26,437 --> 00:54:29,649
Your talent for horseshit rivals my own.

694
00:54:29,816 --> 00:54:32,401
If it weren't for those Accords,
Vision would've been right here.

695
00:54:33,152 --> 00:54:36,364
I remember your signature
on those papers, Colonel.

696
00:54:36,864 --> 00:54:37,865
That's right.

697
00:54:39,867 --> 00:54:41,702
And I'm pretty sure I paid for that.

698
00:54:41,869 --> 00:54:43,079
You have second thoughts?

699
00:54:43,246 --> 00:54:44,956
Not anymore.

700
00:54:50,795 --> 00:54:52,380
Mr. Secretary.

701
00:54:56,926 --> 00:54:58,594
You got some nerve.

702
00:54:59,262 --> 00:55:00,888
I'll give you that.

703
00:55:01,055 --> 00:55:02,807
You could use some of that right now.

704
00:55:03,641 --> 00:55:05,893
The world's on fire.

705
00:55:06,686 --> 00:55:09,772
And you think all is forgiven?

706
00:55:10,356 --> 00:55:14,443
I'm not looking for forgiveness.
And I'm way past asking permission.

707
00:55:16,404 --> 00:55:18,447
Earth just lost her best defender.

708
00:55:18,948 --> 00:55:20,158
So we're here to fight.

709
00:55:21,742 --> 00:55:23,661
And if you wanna stand in our way...

710
00:55:24,662 --> 00:55:26,581
we'll fight you too.

711
00:55:29,834 --> 00:55:30,835
Arrest them.

712
00:55:31,961 --> 00:55:33,546
All over it.

713
00:55:38,634 --> 00:55:40,011
That's a court-martial.

714
00:55:42,472 --> 00:55:43,473
It's great to see you, Cap.

715
00:55:44,599 --> 00:55:45,892
You too, Rhodey.

716
00:55:46,434 --> 00:55:47,435
Hey.

717
00:55:49,103 --> 00:55:51,063
Wow. You guys...

718
00:55:51,898 --> 00:55:53,900
really look like crap.

719
00:55:54,066 --> 00:55:55,651
Must've been a rough couple years.

720
00:55:55,818 --> 00:55:58,488
Yeah, well, the hotels
weren't exactly five star.

721
00:55:58,946 --> 00:56:01,115
I think you look great.

722
00:56:08,206 --> 00:56:10,249
Yeah, I'm back.

723
00:56:11,918 --> 00:56:12,919
Hi, Bruce.

724
00:56:18,466 --> 00:56:19,467
Nat.

725
00:56:22,887 --> 00:56:24,430
This is awkward.

726
00:56:26,933 --> 00:56:28,476
So we gotta assume
they're coming back, right?

727
00:56:28,643 --> 00:56:29,811
And they can clearly find us.

728
00:56:29,977 --> 00:56:32,188
We need all hands on deck. Where's Clint?

729
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:35,566
After the whole Accords situation,
he and Scott took a deal.

730
00:56:35,733 --> 00:56:37,235
It was too tough on their families.
They're on house arrest.

731
00:56:37,401 --> 00:56:38,694
- Who's Scott?
- Ant-Man.

732
00:56:38,861 --> 00:56:40,321
There's an Ant-Man and a Spider-Man?

733
00:56:41,239 --> 00:56:42,198
Okay, look.

734
00:56:42,365 --> 00:56:45,201
Thanos has the biggest army
in the universe...

735
00:56:45,368 --> 00:56:48,788
and he is not gonna stop until he gets...

736
00:56:50,790 --> 00:56:51,666
Vision's stone.

737
00:56:51,833 --> 00:56:53,084
Then we have to protect it.

738
00:56:53,251 --> 00:56:54,877
No, we have to destroy it.

739
00:56:57,046 --> 00:56:59,423
I've been giving a good deal of thought
to this entity in my head.

740
00:56:59,590 --> 00:57:01,092
About its nature.

741
00:57:01,634 --> 00:57:03,803
But also its composition.

742
00:57:03,970 --> 00:57:07,890
I think if it were exposed to
a sufficiently powerful energy source...

743
00:57:08,057 --> 00:57:11,894
something very similar
to its own signature, perhaps...

744
00:57:13,479 --> 00:57:15,648
its molecular integrity could fail.

745
00:57:16,190 --> 00:57:18,442
Yeah, and you with it.

746
00:57:18,901 --> 00:57:20,361
We're not having this conversation.

747
00:57:20,528 --> 00:57:24,615
Eliminating the stone is the only way
to be certain that Thanos can't get it.

748
00:57:25,158 --> 00:57:27,368
That's too high a price.

749
00:57:31,873 --> 00:57:34,250
Only you have the power to pay it.

750
00:57:38,504 --> 00:57:40,548
Thanos threatens half the universe.

751
00:57:40,715 --> 00:57:43,259
One life cannot stand in the way
of defeating him.

752
00:57:43,426 --> 00:57:44,844
But it should.

753
00:57:47,346 --> 00:57:48,723
We don't trade lives, Vision.

754
00:57:48,890 --> 00:57:50,850
Captain, 70 years ago,
you laid down your life...

755
00:57:51,017 --> 00:57:52,810
to save how many millions of people?

756
00:57:52,977 --> 00:57:55,021
Tell me, why is this any different?

757
00:57:55,188 --> 00:57:57,482
Because you might have a choice.

758
00:57:58,774 --> 00:58:02,570
Your mind is made up
of a complex construct of overlays.

759
00:58:02,737 --> 00:58:06,324
Jarvis, Ultron, Tony, me, the stone.

760
00:58:06,491 --> 00:58:09,827
All of them mixed together,
all of them learning from one another.

761
00:58:10,203 --> 00:58:11,954
You're saying Vision isn't just the stone?

762
00:58:12,121 --> 00:58:15,208
I'm saying that if we take out the stone...

763
00:58:15,374 --> 00:58:18,336
there's still a whole lot of Vision left.
Perhaps the best parts.

764
00:58:18,669 --> 00:58:20,004
Can we do that?

765
00:58:20,713 --> 00:58:21,756
Not me, not here.

766
00:58:22,757 --> 00:58:25,551
Well, you better find someone
and somewhere fast.

767
00:58:25,718 --> 00:58:28,387
Ross isn't just gonna let you guys
have your old rooms back.

768
00:58:31,432 --> 00:58:33,017
I know somewhere.

769
00:58:47,907 --> 00:58:50,284
The Kingsguard and the Dora Milaje
have been alerted.

770
00:58:50,451 --> 00:58:51,994
And the Border Tribe?

771
00:58:52,453 --> 00:58:54,038
Those that are left.

772
00:58:54,330 --> 00:58:56,457
Send word to the Jabari as well.

773
00:58:56,624 --> 00:58:58,709
M'Baku likes a good fight.

774
00:59:01,003 --> 00:59:02,713
And what of this one?

775
00:59:03,339 --> 00:59:05,466
This one may be tired of war.

776
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:08,845
But the White Wolf has rested long enough.

777
00:59:31,492 --> 00:59:33,077
Where's the fight?

778
00:59:33,995 --> 00:59:35,413
On its way.

779
00:59:53,806 --> 00:59:56,392
In all the time I've served Thanos...

780
00:59:58,269 --> 01:00:00,271
I have never failed him.

781
01:00:05,318 --> 01:00:08,446
If I were to reach our rendezvous on Titan...

782
01:00:08,613 --> 01:00:12,450
with the Time Stone still attached
to your vaguely irritating person...

783
01:00:12,617 --> 01:00:15,203
there would be judgment.

784
01:00:23,794 --> 01:00:25,338
Give me...

785
01:00:29,342 --> 01:00:30,176
the stone.

786
01:00:42,772 --> 01:00:45,191
Wow, you're a seriously loyal piece
of outerwear, aren't you?

787
01:00:45,358 --> 01:00:47,360
Yeah, speaking of loyalty...

788
01:00:47,944 --> 01:00:48,945
What the...

789
01:00:49,111 --> 01:00:50,863
- I know what you're gonna say.
- You should not be here.

790
01:00:51,030 --> 01:00:52,073
- I was gonna go home.
- I don't wanna hear it.

791
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:53,783
But it was such a long way down
and I just thought about you on the way...

792
01:00:53,950 --> 01:00:55,660
- And now I gotta hear it.
- ...and kinda stuck to the side of the ship.

793
01:00:55,827 --> 01:00:57,870
And this suit is ridiculously intuitive,
by the way.

794
01:00:58,037 --> 01:00:59,038
God damn it.

795
01:00:59,205 --> 01:01:01,999
So, if anything,
it's kinda your fault that I'm here.

796
01:01:02,166 --> 01:01:03,501
- What did you just say?
- I take that back.

797
01:01:03,668 --> 01:01:07,547
- And now, I'm here in space.
- Yeah, right where I didn't want you to be.

798
01:01:07,713 --> 01:01:09,799
This isn't Coney Island.
This isn't a field trip.

799
01:01:09,966 --> 01:01:12,009
This is a one-way ticket. You hear me?

800
01:01:12,176 --> 01:01:13,845
- Don't pretend you thought this through.
- No, I did think this through.

801
01:01:14,011 --> 01:01:15,638
You could not have possibly
thought this through.

802
01:01:15,805 --> 01:01:19,058
You can't be a friendly neighborhood
Spider-Man if there's no neighborhood.

803
01:01:21,227 --> 01:01:23,771
Okay, that didn't really make sense,
but you know what I'm trying to say.

804
01:01:26,649 --> 01:01:28,676
Come on. We got a situation.

805
01:01:29,819 --> 01:01:31,779
See him down there?
He's in trouble. What's your plan?

806
01:01:31,946 --> 01:01:33,114
Go.

807
01:01:33,781 --> 01:01:34,782
Okay, okay...

808
01:01:35,491 --> 01:01:38,703
Okay. Did you ever see
this really old movie, Aliens?

809
01:01:42,415 --> 01:01:44,500
Painful, aren't they?

810
01:01:45,293 --> 01:01:48,254
They were originally designed
for microsurgery.

811
01:01:48,921 --> 01:01:51,007
And any one of them...

812
01:01:56,095 --> 01:01:58,306
could end your friend's life in an instant.

813
01:01:58,890 --> 01:02:00,516
I gotta tell you, he's not really my friend.

814
01:02:00,683 --> 01:02:03,352
Saving his life is
more of a professional courtesy.

815
01:02:05,146 --> 01:02:06,898
You've saved nothing.

816
01:02:07,773 --> 01:02:11,068
Your powers are inconsequential
compared to mine.

817
01:02:11,486 --> 01:02:13,112
Yeah, but the kid's seen more movies.

818
01:02:27,293 --> 01:02:29,462
Yes! Wait. What are those?

819
01:02:45,102 --> 01:02:46,813
Hey, we haven't officially met.

820
01:02:48,105 --> 01:02:49,190
Cool.

821
01:02:51,150 --> 01:02:52,610
We gotta turn this ship around.

822
01:02:52,777 --> 01:02:54,821
Yeah, now he wants to run. Great plan.

823
01:02:54,987 --> 01:02:56,364
No, I want to protect the stone.

824
01:02:56,531 --> 01:02:59,325
And I want you to thank me.
Now, go ahead. I'm listening.

825
01:02:59,492 --> 01:03:02,203
For what? Nearly blasting me into space?

826
01:03:02,370 --> 01:03:04,622
Who just saved your magical ass? Me.

827
01:03:04,789 --> 01:03:07,041
I seriously don't know
how you fit your head into that helmet.

828
01:03:07,208 --> 01:03:09,460
Admit it, you should've ducked out
when I told you to.

829
01:03:09,627 --> 01:03:11,128
I tried to bench you. You refused.

830
01:03:11,295 --> 01:03:13,214
Unlike everyone else in your life,
I don't work for you.

831
01:03:13,381 --> 01:03:16,384
And due to that fact,
we're now in a flying doughnut...

832
01:03:16,551 --> 01:03:18,219
billions of miles from Earth with no backup.

833
01:03:18,386 --> 01:03:20,304
- I'm backup.
- No, you're a stowaway.

834
01:03:20,471 --> 01:03:21,472
The adults are talking.

835
01:03:21,639 --> 01:03:24,225
I'm sorry, I'm confused
as to the relationship here.

836
01:03:24,392 --> 01:03:26,018
What is he, your ward?

837
01:03:26,185 --> 01:03:27,186
No.

838
01:03:27,687 --> 01:03:29,564
- I'm Peter, by the way.
- Doctor Strange.

839
01:03:29,730 --> 01:03:30,982
Oh, you're using our made-up names.

840
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:33,609
I'm Spider-Man, then.

841
01:03:34,569 --> 01:03:37,155
This ship is self-correcting its course.
Thing's on autopilot.

842
01:03:37,321 --> 01:03:39,031
Can we control it?

843
01:03:39,198 --> 01:03:41,117
Fly us home?

844
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:45,121
- Stark?
- Yeah.

845
01:03:45,288 --> 01:03:46,539
Can you get us home?

846
01:03:46,706 --> 01:03:47,957
Yeah, I heard you.

847
01:03:49,250 --> 01:03:51,711
I'm thinking I'm not so sure we should.

848
01:03:52,378 --> 01:03:56,507
Under no circumstances
can we bring the Time Stone to Thanos.

849
01:03:56,674 --> 01:03:58,926
I don't think you quite understand
what's at stake here.

850
01:03:59,093 --> 01:04:01,429
What? No. It's you who doesn't understand...

851
01:04:01,596 --> 01:04:04,348
that Thanos has been
inside my head for six years.

852
01:04:04,515 --> 01:04:07,727
Since he sent an army to New York
and now he's back.

853
01:04:07,894 --> 01:04:09,812
And I don't know what to do.

854
01:04:09,979 --> 01:04:13,024
So I'm not so sure if it's a better plan
to fight him on our turf or his...

855
01:04:13,191 --> 01:04:16,819
but you saw what they did, what they can do.

856
01:04:16,986 --> 01:04:19,197
At least on his turf, he's not expecting it.

857
01:04:19,363 --> 01:04:22,116
So I say we take the fight to him.

858
01:04:22,283 --> 01:04:23,284
Doctor.

859
01:04:24,994 --> 01:04:26,662
Do you concur?

860
01:04:29,123 --> 01:04:31,709
All right, Stark. We go to him.

861
01:04:32,793 --> 01:04:34,837
But you have to understand...

862
01:04:35,004 --> 01:04:39,217
if it comes to saving you or the kid
or the Time Stone...

863
01:04:39,383 --> 01:04:42,220
I will not hesitate to let either of you die.

864
01:04:43,054 --> 01:04:46,724
I can't, because the universe depends on it.

865
01:04:47,308 --> 01:04:50,186
Nice. Good, moral compass.

866
01:04:51,479 --> 01:04:52,980
We're straight.

867
01:04:54,106 --> 01:04:55,608
All right, kid.

868
01:04:56,901 --> 01:04:57,944
You're an Avenger now.

869
01:05:34,438 --> 01:05:36,732
I thought you might be hungry.

870
01:05:48,870 --> 01:05:50,454
I always hated that chair.

871
01:05:50,621 --> 01:05:52,665
So I've been told.

872
01:05:53,332 --> 01:05:57,253
Even so, I'd hoped you'd sit in it one day.

873
01:05:58,004 --> 01:05:59,547
I hated this room.

874
01:06:00,423 --> 01:06:01,716
This ship.

875
01:06:01,883 --> 01:06:03,676
I hated my life.

876
01:06:08,097 --> 01:06:10,349
You told me that too.

877
01:06:13,519 --> 01:06:14,896
Every day.

878
01:06:17,690 --> 01:06:19,650
For almost 20 years.

879
01:06:22,195 --> 01:06:24,614
I was a child when you took me.

880
01:06:25,490 --> 01:06:26,824
I saved you.

881
01:06:30,328 --> 01:06:31,329
No.

882
01:06:32,830 --> 01:06:36,375
No. We were happy on my home planet.

883
01:06:36,542 --> 01:06:39,921
Going to bed hungry, scrounging for scraps.

884
01:06:40,087 --> 01:06:45,134
Your planet was on the brink of collapse.
I'm the one who stopped that.

885
01:06:45,593 --> 01:06:47,428
Do you know what's happened since then?

886
01:06:47,595 --> 01:06:49,222
The children born...

887
01:06:49,806 --> 01:06:53,226
have known nothing but full bellies
and clear skies.

888
01:06:53,392 --> 01:06:54,644
It's a paradise.

889
01:06:57,313 --> 01:06:59,190
Because you murdered half the planet.

890
01:06:59,357 --> 01:07:02,235
A small price to pay for salvation.

891
01:07:02,401 --> 01:07:03,402
You're insane.

892
01:07:03,569 --> 01:07:05,530
Little one, it's a simple calculus.

893
01:07:05,696 --> 01:07:08,491
This universe is finite,
its resources finite.

894
01:07:09,033 --> 01:07:13,037
If life is left unchecked,
life will cease to exist.

895
01:07:13,454 --> 01:07:14,539
It needs correction.

896
01:07:14,705 --> 01:07:16,082
You don't know that!

897
01:07:17,625 --> 01:07:19,669
I'm the only one who knows that.

898
01:07:20,461 --> 01:07:24,674
At least, I'm the only one
with the will to act on it.

899
01:07:26,259 --> 01:07:27,260
For a time...

900
01:07:29,846 --> 01:07:34,100
you had that same will...

901
01:07:35,685 --> 01:07:38,104
as you fought by my side.

902
01:07:38,980 --> 01:07:40,022
Daughter.

903
01:07:40,815 --> 01:07:42,608
I'm not your daughter.

904
01:07:45,027 --> 01:07:47,780
Everything I hate about myself you taught me.

905
01:07:48,573 --> 01:07:52,326
And, in doing so, made you
the fiercest woman in the galaxy.

906
01:07:55,246 --> 01:07:58,082
That's why I trusted you
to find the Soul Stone.

907
01:08:01,460 --> 01:08:03,921
I'm sorry I disappointed you.

908
01:08:05,465 --> 01:08:07,258
I am disappointed.

909
01:08:08,050 --> 01:08:10,511
But not because you didn't find it.

910
01:08:14,223 --> 01:08:15,850
But because you did.

911
01:08:17,310 --> 01:08:19,061
And you lied.

912
01:08:36,162 --> 01:08:37,288
Nebula.

913
01:08:44,545 --> 01:08:45,880
Don't do this.

914
01:08:46,047 --> 01:08:50,051
Some time ago, your sister
snuck aboard this ship to kill me.

915
01:08:50,218 --> 01:08:51,135
Please don't do this.

916
01:08:51,302 --> 01:08:53,596
And very nearly succeeded.

917
01:08:54,263 --> 01:08:55,723
So I brought her here.

918
01:08:57,266 --> 01:08:58,518
To talk.

919
01:09:06,150 --> 01:09:08,569
Stop. Stop it.

920
01:09:14,450 --> 01:09:16,786
I swear to you on my life.

921
01:09:17,286 --> 01:09:19,580
I never found the Soul Stone.

922
01:09:23,709 --> 01:09:25,294
Accessing memory files.

923
01:09:25,461 --> 01:09:26,796
You know what he's about to do.

924
01:09:26,963 --> 01:09:29,549
He's finally ready,
and he's going for the stones.

925
01:09:29,715 --> 01:09:30,842
- All of them.
- He can never get them all.

926
01:09:31,008 --> 01:09:34,011
- He will!
- He can't, Nebula.

927
01:09:34,178 --> 01:09:36,472
Because I found the map to the Soul Stone...

928
01:09:36,639 --> 01:09:39,475
and I burned it to ash. I burned it.

929
01:09:44,522 --> 01:09:46,315
You're strong.

930
01:09:48,359 --> 01:09:49,360
Me.

931
01:09:51,946 --> 01:09:53,531
You're generous.

932
01:09:54,866 --> 01:09:55,867
Me.

933
01:09:57,869 --> 01:10:00,288
But I never taught you to lie.

934
01:10:00,454 --> 01:10:03,082
That's why you're so bad at it.

935
01:10:05,293 --> 01:10:09,839
Where is the Soul Stone?

936
01:10:27,231 --> 01:10:28,191
Vormir!

937
01:10:46,375 --> 01:10:47,960
The stone is on Vormir.

938
01:10:51,255 --> 01:10:53,716
Show me.

939
01:10:55,551 --> 01:10:56,886
I am Groot.

940
01:10:57,053 --> 01:10:59,597
Tinkle in the cup.
We're not looking. What's there to see?

941
01:10:59,764 --> 01:11:01,933
What's a twig?
Everybody's seen a twig before.

942
01:11:02,099 --> 01:11:03,184
I am Groot.

943
01:11:03,351 --> 01:11:05,978
Tree, pour what's in the cup
out into space and go in the cup again.

944
01:11:06,270 --> 01:11:07,480
You speak Groot?

945
01:11:07,647 --> 01:11:09,440
Yes, they taught it on Asgard.
It was an elective.

946
01:11:09,607 --> 01:11:10,650
I am Groot.

947
01:11:10,817 --> 01:11:12,819
You'll know when we're close.

948
01:11:12,985 --> 01:11:16,864
Nidavellir's forge harnesses
the blazing power of a neutron star.

949
01:11:19,700 --> 01:11:21,702
It's the birthplace of my hammer.

950
01:11:22,411 --> 01:11:24,163
It's truly awesome.

951
01:11:30,211 --> 01:11:33,339
Okay, time to be the captain.

952
01:11:38,344 --> 01:11:39,887
So, dead brother, huh?

953
01:11:40,555 --> 01:11:42,390
Yeah, that could be annoying.

954
01:11:42,890 --> 01:11:44,767
Well, he's been dead before.

955
01:11:46,227 --> 01:11:48,771
But, no, this time I think
it really might be true.

956
01:11:49,230 --> 01:11:51,566
And you said your sister and your dad?

957
01:11:51,732 --> 01:11:53,025
Both dead.

958
01:11:53,651 --> 01:11:55,319
But still got a mom, though?

959
01:11:55,820 --> 01:11:57,071
Killed by a dark elf.

960
01:11:57,238 --> 01:11:58,197
A best friend?

961
01:11:58,364 --> 01:11:59,699
Stabbed through the heart.

962
01:12:03,077 --> 01:12:06,247
You sure you're up
to this particular murder mission?

963
01:12:08,499 --> 01:12:09,959
Absolutely.

964
01:12:10,126 --> 01:12:13,629
Rage and vengeance, anger, loss, regret...

965
01:12:13,796 --> 01:12:16,466
they're all tremendous motivators.
They really clear the mind.

966
01:12:16,632 --> 01:12:18,259
So I'm good to go.

967
01:12:18,926 --> 01:12:21,095
Yeah, but this Thanos we're talkin' about...

968
01:12:21,554 --> 01:12:23,848
he's the toughest there is.

969
01:12:24,015 --> 01:12:26,058
- Well, he's never fought me.
- Yeah, he has.

970
01:12:26,225 --> 01:12:27,768
He's never fought me twice.

971
01:12:28,394 --> 01:12:30,146
And I'm getting a new hammer, don't forget.

972
01:12:30,313 --> 01:12:32,565
It better be some hammer.

973
01:12:36,694 --> 01:12:39,071
You know, I'm 1,500 years old.

974
01:12:39,739 --> 01:12:41,782
I've killed twice as many enemies as that.

975
01:12:41,949 --> 01:12:44,994
And every one of them would've rather
killed me, but none succeeded.

976
01:12:45,661 --> 01:12:48,581
I'm only alive because fate wants me alive.

977
01:12:48,748 --> 01:12:51,542
Thanos is just the latest
in a long line of bastards...

978
01:12:51,709 --> 01:12:53,586
and he'll be the latest to feel my vengeance.

979
01:12:53,753 --> 01:12:55,546
Fate wills it so.

980
01:12:57,048 --> 01:12:58,883
And what if you're wrong?

981
01:13:02,178 --> 01:13:03,971
If I'm wrong, then...

982
01:13:05,223 --> 01:13:06,808
what more could I lose?

983
01:13:20,613 --> 01:13:24,200
I could lose a lot.
Me, personally, I could lose a lot.

984
01:13:27,995 --> 01:13:28,996
Okay.

985
01:13:32,083 --> 01:13:34,168
If fate does want you
to kill that crapsack...

986
01:13:34,335 --> 01:13:36,045
you're gonna need more
than one stupid eyeball.

987
01:13:36,212 --> 01:13:38,214
- What's this?
- What's it look like?

988
01:13:38,548 --> 01:13:40,967
Some jerk lost a bet with me on Contraxia.

989
01:13:41,300 --> 01:13:42,385
He gave you his eye?

990
01:13:42,552 --> 01:13:43,678
No, he gave me 100 credits.

991
01:13:43,845 --> 01:13:46,806
I snuck into his room later that night
and stole his eye.

992
01:13:48,724 --> 01:13:49,976
Thank you, sweet rabbit.

993
01:13:58,276 --> 01:13:59,777
I would've washed that.

994
01:14:01,028 --> 01:14:03,531
The only way I could
sneak it off Contraxia was up my...

995
01:14:04,866 --> 01:14:05,950
Hey, we're here!

996
01:14:09,954 --> 01:14:11,080
I don't think this thing works.

997
01:14:11,247 --> 01:14:12,415
Everything seems dark.

998
01:14:14,876 --> 01:14:16,586
It ain't the eye.

999
01:14:29,932 --> 01:14:31,309
Something's wrong.

1000
01:14:32,101 --> 01:14:33,644
The star's gone out.

1001
01:14:34,770 --> 01:14:36,063
And the rings are frozen.

1002
01:14:57,210 --> 01:15:00,505
I hope these dwarves are better
at forging than they are cleaning.

1003
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:08,846
Maybe they realized that they live
in a junk pile in the middle of space.

1004
01:15:09,013 --> 01:15:11,974
This forge hasn't gone dark in centuries.

1005
01:15:14,268 --> 01:15:16,896
You said Thanos had a gauntlet, right?

1006
01:15:17,063 --> 01:15:18,231
Yes, why?

1007
01:15:18,397 --> 01:15:20,441
It look anything like that?

1008
01:15:23,861 --> 01:15:25,613
I am Groot.

1009
01:15:25,780 --> 01:15:27,281
Go back to the pod.

1010
01:15:31,369 --> 01:15:32,328
Eitri, wait!

1011
01:15:33,329 --> 01:15:34,330
Stop!

1012
01:15:35,248 --> 01:15:36,249
Stop.

1013
01:15:37,124 --> 01:15:37,959
Thor?

1014
01:15:41,295 --> 01:15:42,672
What happened here?

1015
01:15:43,089 --> 01:15:45,383
You were supposed to protect us.

1016
01:15:46,300 --> 01:15:48,928
Asgard was supposed to protect us.

1017
01:15:49,095 --> 01:15:51,305
Asgard is destroyed.

1018
01:15:53,558 --> 01:15:57,395
Eitri, the glove. What did you do?

1019
01:16:10,158 --> 01:16:13,161
300 dwarves lived on this ring.

1020
01:16:14,537 --> 01:16:17,456
I thought if I did what he asked,
they'd be safe.

1021
01:16:19,959 --> 01:16:21,419
I made what he wanted.

1022
01:16:23,129 --> 01:16:27,467
A device capable of harnessing
the power of the stones.

1023
01:16:32,013 --> 01:16:34,599
Then he killed everyone anyway.

1024
01:16:36,684 --> 01:16:38,478
All except me.

1025
01:16:39,562 --> 01:16:41,439
"Your life is yours," he said.

1026
01:16:42,732 --> 01:16:46,694
"But your hands are mine alone."

1027
01:16:47,653 --> 01:16:49,655
Eitri, this isn't about your hands.

1028
01:16:50,781 --> 01:16:53,868
Every weapon you've ever designed,
every axe, hammer, sword...

1029
01:16:54,035 --> 01:16:56,245
it's all inside your head.

1030
01:16:57,121 --> 01:16:59,040
Now, I know it feels like all hope is lost.

1031
01:16:59,207 --> 01:17:00,750
Trust me, I know.

1032
01:17:01,209 --> 01:17:05,922
But together, you and I, we can kill Thanos.

1033
01:17:46,295 --> 01:17:48,589
Mantis, listen very carefully.

1034
01:17:48,756 --> 01:17:50,967
I need you to meet me on Titan.

1035
01:17:57,723 --> 01:17:58,641
Hey, what's going on?

1036
01:17:58,808 --> 01:18:00,017
I think we're here.

1037
01:18:00,184 --> 01:18:02,645
I don't think this rig has
a self-park function.

1038
01:18:04,397 --> 01:18:07,066
Get your hand inside the steering gimbal.
Close those around it.

1039
01:18:08,734 --> 01:18:09,777
- You understand?
- Yep, got it.

1040
01:18:09,944 --> 01:18:11,904
This was meant for one big guy,
so we gotta move at the same time.

1041
01:18:12,071 --> 01:18:12,989
Okay, okay. Ready.

1042
01:18:17,618 --> 01:18:18,619
We might wanna turn.

1043
01:18:18,786 --> 01:18:20,037
Turn! Turn! Turn!

1044
01:18:49,984 --> 01:18:51,486
You all right?

1045
01:18:52,987 --> 01:18:54,238
That was close.

1046
01:18:55,615 --> 01:18:56,866
I owe you one.

1047
01:18:57,366 --> 01:19:01,287
Let me just say, if aliens wind up
implanting eggs in my chest or something...

1048
01:19:01,454 --> 01:19:02,580
and I eat one of you, I'm sorry.

1049
01:19:02,747 --> 01:19:05,082
I do not want another single
pop culture reference

1050
01:19:05,166 --> 01:19:06,828
out of you for the rest of the trip.
You understand?

1051
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:08,294
I'm trying to say that something is coming.

1052
01:19:15,718 --> 01:19:16,803
Thanos!

1053
01:19:38,115 --> 01:19:39,617
Please don't put your eggs in me!

1054
01:19:41,828 --> 01:19:43,579
Stay down, clown.

1055
01:19:48,793 --> 01:19:50,878
Die, blanket of death!

1056
01:19:56,801 --> 01:19:59,720
Everybody stay where you are.
Chill the eff out.

1057
01:20:00,930 --> 01:20:02,932
I'm gonna ask you this one time.

1058
01:20:03,683 --> 01:20:04,934
Where is Gamora?

1059
01:20:05,101 --> 01:20:07,603
Yeah. I'll do you one better. Who's Gamora?

1060
01:20:07,895 --> 01:20:10,690
I'll do you one better. Why is Gamora?

1061
01:20:10,857 --> 01:20:14,110
Tell me where the girl is or I swear to you
I'm gonna French fry this little freak.

1062
01:20:14,277 --> 01:20:17,113
Let's do it. You shoot my guy
and I'll blast him. Let's go!

1063
01:20:17,697 --> 01:20:20,283
Do it, Quill! I can take it.

1064
01:20:20,449 --> 01:20:22,451
- No, he can't take it!
- She's right. You can't.

1065
01:20:22,618 --> 01:20:24,662
Oh, yeah? You don't wanna tell me
where she is? That's fine.

1066
01:20:24,829 --> 01:20:27,790
I'll kill all three of you
and I'll beat it out of Thanos myself.

1067
01:20:27,957 --> 01:20:28,875
Starting with you.

1068
01:20:29,041 --> 01:20:32,295
Wait, what, Thanos?
All right, let me ask you this one time.

1069
01:20:32,795 --> 01:20:34,464
What master do you serve?

1070
01:20:34,630 --> 01:20:37,425
What master do I serve?
What am I supposed to say, "Jesus"?

1071
01:20:38,718 --> 01:20:40,428
- You're from Earth.
- I'm not from Earth, I'm from Missouri.

1072
01:20:40,595 --> 01:20:41,929
Yeah, that's on Earth, dipshit.

1073
01:20:42,096 --> 01:20:43,139
What are you hassling us for?

1074
01:20:43,306 --> 01:20:45,057
So you're not with Thanos?

1075
01:20:45,558 --> 01:20:47,351
With Thanos?

1076
01:20:47,935 --> 01:20:50,521
No, I'm here to kill Thanos.

1077
01:20:50,688 --> 01:20:52,523
He took my girl. Wait, who are you?

1078
01:20:53,357 --> 01:20:54,817
We're the Avengers, man.

1079
01:20:54,984 --> 01:20:57,445
You're the ones Thor told us about.

1080
01:20:57,612 --> 01:20:58,779
You know Thor?

1081
01:20:58,946 --> 01:21:02,575
Yeah. Tall guy, not that good-looking,
needed saving.

1082
01:21:02,742 --> 01:21:04,410
Where is he now?

1083
01:21:19,467 --> 01:21:21,344
This is the plan?
We're gonna hit him with a brick?

1084
01:21:21,511 --> 01:21:22,720
It's a mold.

1085
01:21:23,554 --> 01:21:24,472
A king's weapon.

1086
01:21:25,431 --> 01:21:27,767
Meant to be the greatest in Asgard.

1087
01:21:28,392 --> 01:21:31,270
In theory, it could even summon the Bifrost.

1088
01:21:31,437 --> 01:21:32,897
Did it have a name?

1089
01:21:34,148 --> 01:21:35,316
Stormbreaker.

1090
01:21:35,775 --> 01:21:36,901
That's a bit much.

1091
01:21:38,945 --> 01:21:40,029
So how do we make it?

1092
01:21:41,864 --> 01:21:44,075
You'll have to restart the forge.

1093
01:21:45,034 --> 01:21:47,245
Awaken the heart of a dying star.

1094
01:21:49,872 --> 01:21:52,500
Rabbit, fire up the pod.

1095
01:21:56,128 --> 01:21:58,131
The hell happened to this planet?

1096
01:21:58,297 --> 01:22:02,385
It's eight degrees off its axis.
Gravitational pull is all over the place.

1097
01:22:03,719 --> 01:22:06,514
Yeah, we got one advantage.
He's coming to us.

1098
01:22:07,473 --> 01:22:10,101
We'll use it. All right, I have a plan.

1099
01:22:10,268 --> 01:22:11,519
Or at least the beginnings of one.

1100
01:22:11,686 --> 01:22:14,313
It's pretty simple. We draw him in,
pin him down, get what we need.

1101
01:22:14,480 --> 01:22:17,275
Definitely don't wanna dance with this guy.
We just want the gauntlet.

1102
01:22:17,859 --> 01:22:18,776
Are you yawning?

1103
01:22:20,319 --> 01:22:22,488
In the middle of this,
while I'm breaking it down?

1104
01:22:22,655 --> 01:22:23,614
Did you hear what I said?

1105
01:22:24,448 --> 01:22:26,701
I stopped listening after you said,
"We need a plan."

1106
01:22:26,868 --> 01:22:27,952
Okay, Mr. Clean is on his own page.

1107
01:22:28,119 --> 01:22:30,955
See, "not winging it"
isn't really what they do.

1108
01:22:31,122 --> 01:22:32,623
What exactly is it that they do?

1109
01:22:32,790 --> 01:22:35,775
Kick names, take ass.
Yeah, that's right.

1110
01:22:42,508 --> 01:22:43,843
All right, just get over here, please.

1111
01:22:44,260 --> 01:22:46,179
Mr. Lord, can you get your folks
to circle up?

1112
01:22:46,345 --> 01:22:48,514
"Mr. Lord." Star-Lord is fine.

1113
01:22:51,225 --> 01:22:52,518
We gotta coalesce.

1114
01:22:52,685 --> 01:22:54,312
'Cause if all we come at him with
is a plucky attitude...

1115
01:22:54,479 --> 01:22:56,772
Dude, don't call us plucky.

1116
01:22:56,939 --> 01:22:58,107
We don't know what it means.

1117
01:22:58,524 --> 01:23:01,110
All right, we're optimistic, yes.
I like your plan.

1118
01:23:01,277 --> 01:23:03,738
Except it sucks, so let me do the plan...

1119
01:23:03,905 --> 01:23:05,823
and that way it might be really good.

1120
01:23:05,990 --> 01:23:07,950
Tell him about the dance-off
to save the universe.

1121
01:23:08,117 --> 01:23:09,160
What dance-off?

1122
01:23:09,327 --> 01:23:10,244
It's nothing.

1123
01:23:10,411 --> 01:23:11,454
Like in Footloose, the movie?

1124
01:23:11,621 --> 01:23:12,997
Exactly like Footloose.

1125
01:23:13,539 --> 01:23:15,041
Is it still the greatest movie in history?

1126
01:23:15,208 --> 01:23:16,334
It never was.

1127
01:23:16,501 --> 01:23:17,835
- Don't encourage this, all right?
- Okay.

1128
01:23:18,002 --> 01:23:19,337
We're getting no help from Flash Gordon here.

1129
01:23:19,504 --> 01:23:21,798
Flash Gordon?
By the way, that's a compliment.

1130
01:23:22,381 --> 01:23:23,883
Don't forget, I'm half human.

1131
01:23:24,050 --> 01:23:25,593
So that 50% of me that's stupid...

1132
01:23:26,803 --> 01:23:27,804
that's 100% you.

1133
01:23:27,970 --> 01:23:30,014
- Your math is blowing my mind.
- Excuse me.

1134
01:23:31,599 --> 01:23:35,019
But does your friend often do that?

1135
01:23:36,437 --> 01:23:38,731
Strange, we all right?

1136
01:23:48,950 --> 01:23:50,785
- You're back. You're all right.
- Hi.

1137
01:23:50,952 --> 01:23:51,953
Hey, what was that?

1138
01:23:52,453 --> 01:23:56,123
I went forward in time
to view alternate futures.

1139
01:23:56,999 --> 01:24:00,461
To see all the possible outcomes
of the coming conflict.

1140
01:24:01,212 --> 01:24:02,547
How many did you see?

1141
01:24:02,713 --> 01:24:04,966
14,000,605.

1142
01:24:06,634 --> 01:24:08,052
How many did we win?

1143
01:24:12,807 --> 01:24:13,975
One.

1144
01:24:35,872 --> 01:24:38,875
The stone had better be up there.

1145
01:24:40,751 --> 01:24:42,795
For your sister's sake.

1146
01:25:03,691 --> 01:25:08,446
Welcome, Thanos, son of Alars.

1147
01:25:10,531 --> 01:25:13,784
Gamora, daughter of Thanos.

1148
01:25:13,951 --> 01:25:15,119
You know us?

1149
01:25:15,286 --> 01:25:19,832
It is my curse to know all who journey here.

1150
01:25:20,333 --> 01:25:22,001
Where is the Soul Stone?

1151
01:25:22,710 --> 01:25:24,378
You should know...

1152
01:25:25,046 --> 01:25:28,174
it extracts a terrible price.

1153
01:25:29,509 --> 01:25:31,093
I am prepared.

1154
01:25:33,554 --> 01:25:35,973
We all think that at first.

1155
01:25:40,520 --> 01:25:42,814
We are all wrong.

1156
01:25:54,408 --> 01:25:56,744
How is it you know this place so well?

1157
01:25:56,911 --> 01:26:01,249
A lifetime ago, I, too, sought the stones.

1158
01:26:01,707 --> 01:26:04,418
I even held one in my hand.

1159
01:26:04,585 --> 01:26:08,631
But it cast me out, banished me here.

1160
01:26:08,798 --> 01:26:12,844
Guiding others to a treasure
I cannot possess.

1161
01:26:21,561 --> 01:26:24,480
What you seek lies in front of you.

1162
01:26:25,439 --> 01:26:27,567
As does what you fear.

1163
01:26:28,317 --> 01:26:29,777
What's this?

1164
01:26:30,278 --> 01:26:31,821
The price.

1165
01:26:31,988 --> 01:26:36,617
Soul holds a special place among
the Infinity Stones.

1166
01:26:37,618 --> 01:26:41,706
You might say it has a certain wisdom.

1167
01:26:43,082 --> 01:26:44,917
Tell me what it needs.

1168
01:26:45,084 --> 01:26:48,629
To ensure that whoever possesses it...

1169
01:26:48,796 --> 01:26:51,340
understands its power...

1170
01:26:52,300 --> 01:26:56,053
the stone demands a sacrifice.

1171
01:26:56,220 --> 01:26:57,763
Of what?

1172
01:26:58,181 --> 01:27:02,643
In order to take the stone,
you must lose that which you love.

1173
01:27:05,563 --> 01:27:06,856
A soul...

1174
01:27:07,523 --> 01:27:08,774
for a soul.

1175
01:27:24,499 --> 01:27:26,834
All my life, I dreamed of a day...

1176
01:27:27,793 --> 01:27:29,170
a moment...

1177
01:27:30,505 --> 01:27:32,590
when you got what you deserved.

1178
01:27:34,801 --> 01:27:37,094
And I was always so disappointed.

1179
01:27:40,681 --> 01:27:42,141
But now...

1180
01:27:46,103 --> 01:27:49,190
You kill and torture...

1181
01:27:51,150 --> 01:27:53,152
and you call it mercy.

1182
01:27:57,240 --> 01:27:59,325
The universe has judged you.

1183
01:28:00,910 --> 01:28:05,373
You asked it for a prize, and it told you no.

1184
01:28:06,916 --> 01:28:08,417
You failed.

1185
01:28:09,794 --> 01:28:11,671
And do you wanna know why?

1186
01:28:12,630 --> 01:28:14,465
Because you love nothing.

1187
01:28:15,174 --> 01:28:16,801
No one.

1188
01:28:22,431 --> 01:28:23,599
No.

1189
01:28:28,229 --> 01:28:29,230
Really?

1190
01:28:30,273 --> 01:28:31,357
Tears?

1191
01:28:32,150 --> 01:28:34,110
They're not for him.

1192
01:28:48,374 --> 01:28:49,584
No.

1193
01:28:51,085 --> 01:28:52,503
This isn't love.

1194
01:28:53,379 --> 01:28:56,048
I ignored my destiny once.

1195
01:28:58,509 --> 01:29:00,678
I cannot do that again.

1196
01:29:01,179 --> 01:29:04,557
Even for you.

1197
01:29:28,748 --> 01:29:31,125
I'm sorry, little one.

1198
01:29:34,962 --> 01:29:36,214
No!

1199
01:31:13,811 --> 01:31:16,647
Drop to 2600, heading 0-3-0.

1200
01:31:16,814 --> 01:31:18,065
I hope you're right about this.

1201
01:31:18,232 --> 01:31:21,110
Or we're gonna land a lot faster
than you want to.

1202
01:31:36,834 --> 01:31:39,337
When you said we were going to open
Wakanda to the rest of the world...

1203
01:31:39,504 --> 01:31:41,756
this is not what I imagined.

1204
01:31:41,923 --> 01:31:43,883
And what did you imagine?

1205
01:31:44,050 --> 01:31:45,176
The Olympics.

1206
01:31:45,343 --> 01:31:47,094
Maybe even a Starbucks.

1207
01:32:01,317 --> 01:32:02,693
Should we bow?

1208
01:32:02,860 --> 01:32:04,111
Yeah, he's a king.

1209
01:32:04,445 --> 01:32:06,447
Seems like I'm always
thanking you for something.

1210
01:32:08,282 --> 01:32:09,742
What are you doing?

1211
01:32:10,159 --> 01:32:11,828
We don't do that here.

1212
01:32:11,994 --> 01:32:14,247
So how big of an assault should we expect?

1213
01:32:14,413 --> 01:32:17,416
Sir, I think you should expect
quite a big assault.

1214
01:32:17,583 --> 01:32:18,501
How we looking?

1215
01:32:18,668 --> 01:32:23,673
You will have my Kingsguard,
the Border Tribe, the Dora Milaje, and...

1216
01:32:24,632 --> 01:32:27,552
And a semi-stable 100-year-old man.

1217
01:32:30,429 --> 01:32:31,597
How you been, Buck?

1218
01:32:31,764 --> 01:32:34,892
Not bad, for the end of the world.

1219
01:32:48,072 --> 01:32:50,158
The structure is polymorphic.

1220
01:32:50,616 --> 01:32:53,494
Right, we had to attach
each neuron non-sequentially.

1221
01:32:53,911 --> 01:32:57,957
Why didn't you just reprogram
the synapses to work collectively?

1222
01:32:59,041 --> 01:33:02,295
Because we didn't think of it.

1223
01:33:02,712 --> 01:33:04,005
I'm sure you did your best.

1224
01:33:04,172 --> 01:33:05,381
Can you do it?

1225
01:33:06,299 --> 01:33:09,594
Yes, but there are
more than two trillion neurons here.

1226
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:12,930
One misalignment could cause
a cascade of circuit failures.

1227
01:33:13,306 --> 01:33:14,390
It will take time, brother.

1228
01:33:16,100 --> 01:33:17,059
How long?

1229
01:33:17,226 --> 01:33:18,436
As long as you can give me.

1230
01:33:23,107 --> 01:33:25,318
Something's entered the atmosphere.

1231
01:33:42,251 --> 01:33:44,545
Hey, Cap, we got a situation here.

1232
01:33:54,055 --> 01:33:55,890
God, I love this place.

1233
01:33:56,057 --> 01:33:59,685
Yeah, don't start celebrating yet, guys.
We got more incoming outside the dome.

1234
01:34:19,080 --> 01:34:19,997
It's too late.

1235
01:34:21,040 --> 01:34:22,291
We need to destroy the stone now.

1236
01:34:22,875 --> 01:34:24,502
Vision, get your ass back on the table.

1237
01:34:24,669 --> 01:34:26,003
We will hold them off.

1238
01:34:26,170 --> 01:34:29,590
Wanda, as soon as that stone's
out of his head...

1239
01:34:29,757 --> 01:34:30,758
you blow it to hell.

1240
01:34:31,175 --> 01:34:32,260
I will.

1241
01:34:32,426 --> 01:34:35,221
Evacuate the city. Engage all defenses.

1242
01:34:35,972 --> 01:34:37,431
And get this man a shield.

1243
01:34:47,859 --> 01:34:50,153
I don't think you get the scientifics here.

1244
01:34:50,319 --> 01:34:52,780
These rings are gigantic.
You wanna get them moving...

1245
01:34:52,947 --> 01:34:55,408
you're gonna need something a lot bigger
to yank 'em loose.

1246
01:34:55,575 --> 01:34:57,660
- Leave that to me.
- Leave it to you?

1247
01:34:57,827 --> 01:35:00,955
Buddy, you're in space.
All you got is a rope and a...

1248
01:35:09,380 --> 01:35:10,381
Fire the engines!

1249
01:35:27,940 --> 01:35:30,610
More power, rabbit!

1250
01:36:02,058 --> 01:36:03,851
Well done, boy.

1251
01:36:05,645 --> 01:36:07,563
That's Nidavellir.

1252
01:36:27,708 --> 01:36:28,626
Damn it.

1253
01:36:29,043 --> 01:36:30,586
"Damn it"? What's "damn it"?

1254
01:36:30,753 --> 01:36:32,630
- The mechanism is crippled.
- What?

1255
01:36:32,797 --> 01:36:34,799
With the iris closed, I can't heat the metal.

1256
01:36:34,966 --> 01:36:36,259
How long will it take to heat it?

1257
01:36:36,717 --> 01:36:39,095
A few minutes, maybe more. Why?

1258
01:36:41,097 --> 01:36:42,140
I'm gonna hold it open.

1259
01:36:42,306 --> 01:36:43,432
That's suicide.

1260
01:36:43,599 --> 01:36:46,018
So is facing Thanos without that axe.

1261
01:36:55,820 --> 01:36:56,863
How we looking, Bruce?

1262
01:36:57,029 --> 01:36:58,698
Yeah, I think I'm getting the hang of it.

1263
01:37:02,451 --> 01:37:06,080
This is amazing, man. It's like
being the Hulk without actually...

1264
01:37:09,917 --> 01:37:12,128
I'm okay. I'm okay.

1265
01:37:13,629 --> 01:37:15,715
I've got two heat signatures
breaking through the tree line.

1266
01:37:44,160 --> 01:37:46,370
Thank you for standing with us.

1267
01:38:08,351 --> 01:38:09,977
Where's your other friend?

1268
01:38:10,728 --> 01:38:13,105
You will pay for his life with yours.

1269
01:38:14,106 --> 01:38:16,567
Thanos will have that stone.

1270
01:38:17,068 --> 01:38:18,528
That's not gonna happen.

1271
01:38:18,694 --> 01:38:20,988
You are in Wakanda now.

1272
01:38:21,155 --> 01:38:24,617
Thanos will have nothing but dust and blood.

1273
01:38:27,870 --> 01:38:29,956
We have blood to spare.

1274
01:38:41,175 --> 01:38:42,718
They surrender?

1275
01:38:43,511 --> 01:38:44,512
Not exactly.

1276
01:39:11,539 --> 01:39:12,957
What the hell?

1277
01:39:15,918 --> 01:39:17,545
Looks like we pissed her off.

1278
01:39:28,306 --> 01:39:29,849
They're killing themselves.

1279
01:40:06,093 --> 01:40:07,678
You see the teeth on those things?

1280
01:40:07,845 --> 01:40:09,639
All right, back up, Sam.
You're gonna get your wings singed.

1281
01:40:22,360 --> 01:40:24,904
Cap, if these things circle the perimeter
and get in behind us...

1282
01:40:25,071 --> 01:40:26,864
there's nothing between them and Vision.

1283
01:40:27,240 --> 01:40:28,991
Then we better keep 'em in front of us.

1284
01:40:29,158 --> 01:40:30,535
How do we do that?

1285
01:40:32,912 --> 01:40:34,539
We open the barrier.

1286
01:40:36,791 --> 01:40:40,920
On my signal,
open North-West Section Seventeen.

1287
01:40:41,254 --> 01:40:44,882
Requesting confirmation, My King.
You said open the barrier?

1288
01:40:45,049 --> 01:40:46,259
On my signal.

1289
01:40:46,509 --> 01:40:48,386
This will be the end of Wakanda.

1290
01:40:49,720 --> 01:40:53,141
Then it will be
the noblest ending in history.

1291
01:41:05,987 --> 01:41:07,572
Wakanda forever!

1292
01:41:20,168 --> 01:41:21,002
Now!

1293
01:41:51,324 --> 01:41:52,742
How much longer, Shuri?

1294
01:41:52,909 --> 01:41:54,452
I've barely begun, brother.

1295
01:41:54,619 --> 01:41:56,454
You might want to pick up the pace.

1296
01:42:03,503 --> 01:42:05,379
Allfathers, give me strength.

1297
01:42:05,546 --> 01:42:07,340
You understand, boy?

1298
01:42:07,507 --> 01:42:10,510
You're about to
take the full force of a star.

1299
01:42:11,469 --> 01:42:12,887
It'll kill you.

1300
01:42:13,554 --> 01:42:15,014
Only if I die.

1301
01:42:16,057 --> 01:42:17,058
Yes.

1302
01:42:17,558 --> 01:42:20,311
That's what killing you means.

1303
01:42:48,297 --> 01:42:50,216
Hold it! Hold it, Thor!

1304
01:43:40,683 --> 01:43:42,643
Thor! Say something. Come on.

1305
01:43:43,561 --> 01:43:44,562
Thor, you okay?

1306
01:43:50,234 --> 01:43:51,527
I think he's dying.

1307
01:43:51,694 --> 01:43:53,654
He needs the axe!

1308
01:43:55,114 --> 01:43:56,449
Where's the handle?

1309
01:43:59,494 --> 01:44:01,829
Tree, help me find the handle!

1310
01:45:10,690 --> 01:45:12,900
There's too many of 'em!

1311
01:45:40,261 --> 01:45:42,722
You guys are so screwed now!

1312
01:45:46,100 --> 01:45:48,102
Bring me Thanos!

1313
01:46:20,843 --> 01:46:22,345
Oh, yeah.

1314
01:46:25,473 --> 01:46:27,475
You're much more of a Thanos.

1315
01:46:29,811 --> 01:46:31,979
I take it the Maw is dead.

1316
01:46:34,273 --> 01:46:36,734
This day extracts a heavy toll.

1317
01:46:38,444 --> 01:46:40,613
Still, he accomplished his mission.

1318
01:46:41,072 --> 01:46:42,573
You may regret that.

1319
01:46:43,407 --> 01:46:46,285
He brought you face-to-face with
the Master of the Mystic Arts.

1320
01:46:49,455 --> 01:46:51,916
And where do you think he brought you?

1321
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:55,711
Let me guess. Your home?

1322
01:47:00,091 --> 01:47:01,384
It was.

1323
01:47:04,137 --> 01:47:05,555
And it was beautiful.

1324
01:47:08,182 --> 01:47:10,643
Titan was like most planets.

1325
01:47:10,810 --> 01:47:13,688
Too many mouths, not enough to go around.

1326
01:47:13,855 --> 01:47:17,108
And when we faced extinction,
I offered a solution.

1327
01:47:18,109 --> 01:47:19,318
Genocide.

1328
01:47:20,027 --> 01:47:24,115
But random, dispassionate,
fair to rich and poor alike.

1329
01:47:25,449 --> 01:47:27,618
They called me a madman.

1330
01:47:28,327 --> 01:47:30,580
And what I predicted came to pass.

1331
01:47:33,291 --> 01:47:35,293
Congratulations, you're a prophet.

1332
01:47:35,877 --> 01:47:37,086
I'm a survivor.

1333
01:47:37,253 --> 01:47:39,464
Who wants to murder trillions.

1334
01:47:39,630 --> 01:47:43,342
With all six stones, I could simply
snap my fingers.

1335
01:47:43,885 --> 01:47:48,598
They would all cease to exist.
I call that mercy.

1336
01:47:50,683 --> 01:47:52,185
And then what?

1337
01:47:53,519 --> 01:47:55,021
I'd finally rest...

1338
01:47:55,813 --> 01:47:58,941
and watch the sun rise
on a grateful universe.

1339
01:48:00,109 --> 01:48:03,654
The hardest choices require
the strongest wills.

1340
01:48:04,489 --> 01:48:09,202
I think you'll find our will equal to yours.

1341
01:48:10,661 --> 01:48:11,537
Our?

1342
01:48:17,710 --> 01:48:19,128
Piece of cake, Quill.

1343
01:48:19,295 --> 01:48:21,547
Yeah, if your goal was to piss him off.

1344
01:48:59,710 --> 01:49:00,920
Boom!

1345
01:49:02,004 --> 01:49:03,881
Don't let him close his fist.

1346
01:49:08,094 --> 01:49:10,672
Magic.
More magic.

1347
01:49:11,556 --> 01:49:12,557
Magic with a kick.

1348
01:49:13,182 --> 01:49:14,183
Magic with a...

1349
01:49:15,518 --> 01:49:16,352
Insect!

1350
01:49:54,223 --> 01:49:55,349
Well, well.

1351
01:49:55,516 --> 01:49:56,559
You should've killed me.

1352
01:49:56,726 --> 01:49:58,436
It would've been a waste of parts!

1353
01:50:04,066 --> 01:50:05,193
Where's Gamora?

1354
01:50:46,692 --> 01:50:50,363
- Is he under? Don't let up.
- Be quick. He is very strong.

1355
01:50:50,530 --> 01:50:52,573
Parker, help! Get over here.

1356
01:50:52,740 --> 01:50:55,034
She can't hold him much longer. Let's go.

1357
01:51:00,540 --> 01:51:01,541
We gotta open his fingers to get it off.

1358
01:51:01,707 --> 01:51:04,326
I thought you'd be hard to catch.
For the record, this was my plan.

1359
01:51:05,461 --> 01:51:09,423
You're not so strong now, huh?
Where is Gamora?

1360
01:51:10,424 --> 01:51:13,678
- My Gamora.
- No, bullshit!

1361
01:51:13,970 --> 01:51:15,263
Where is she?

1362
01:51:16,347 --> 01:51:17,640
He is in anguish.

1363
01:51:18,349 --> 01:51:19,475
Good.

1364
01:51:21,644 --> 01:51:22,770
He mourns.

1365
01:51:23,312 --> 01:51:26,941
What does this monster have to mourn?

1366
01:51:27,817 --> 01:51:28,734
Gamora.

1367
01:51:32,613 --> 01:51:33,614
What?

1368
01:51:34,031 --> 01:51:35,533
He took her to Vormir.

1369
01:51:36,159 --> 01:51:38,119
He came back with the Soul Stone.

1370
01:51:38,911 --> 01:51:40,413
But she didn't.

1371
01:51:42,331 --> 01:51:45,501
Okay, Quill, you gotta cool it
right now. You understand?

1372
01:51:46,377 --> 01:51:49,839
Don't, don't. Don't engage.
We almost got this off!

1373
01:51:51,257 --> 01:51:52,091
Tell me she's lying.

1374
01:51:54,552 --> 01:51:57,346
Asshole, tell me you didn't do it!

1375
01:51:58,806 --> 01:52:02,226
I had to.

1376
01:52:02,977 --> 01:52:04,395
No, you didn't.

1377
01:52:04,854 --> 01:52:06,272
No, you didn't.

1378
01:52:10,109 --> 01:52:11,444
- No, you didn't!
- Quill!

1379
01:52:11,611 --> 01:52:13,404
Hey, stop! Hey, stop! Stop!

1380
01:52:14,113 --> 01:52:17,074
- Hey, stop! Stop!
- It's coming, it's coming. I got it, I got it!

1381
01:52:20,703 --> 01:52:21,704
Oh, God.

1382
01:53:20,930 --> 01:53:23,266
Come and get some, space dogs!

1383
01:53:26,602 --> 01:53:29,188
Come on! Get some! Get some!

1384
01:53:29,355 --> 01:53:31,274
Come on! Get some!

1385
01:53:31,524 --> 01:53:33,568
- How much for the gun?
- Not for sale.

1386
01:53:34,193 --> 01:53:36,070
Okay. How much for the arm?

1387
01:53:37,947 --> 01:53:39,949
Oh, I'll get that arm.

1388
01:53:48,833 --> 01:53:49,834
New haircut?

1389
01:53:50,209 --> 01:53:51,502
Noticed you've copied my beard.

1390
01:53:54,130 --> 01:53:55,882
By the way, this is a friend of mine, Tree.

1391
01:53:56,799 --> 01:53:58,718
I am Groot.

1392
01:53:59,719 --> 01:54:01,179
I am Steve Rogers.

1393
01:54:21,240 --> 01:54:23,409
Fall back! Fall back, now!

1394
01:54:32,835 --> 01:54:34,545
Focus that fire on the left flank, Sam.

1395
01:54:35,129 --> 01:54:36,255
I'm doing it.

1396
01:55:00,154 --> 01:55:01,781
Why was she up there all this time?

1397
01:55:02,740 --> 01:55:05,618
She's on the field. Take it.

1398
01:55:37,233 --> 01:55:39,360
Guys, we got a Vision situation here.

1399
01:55:42,113 --> 01:55:43,489
Somebody get to Vision!

1400
01:55:44,240 --> 01:55:45,074
I got him!

1401
01:55:45,241 --> 01:55:46,833
On my way.

1402
01:55:51,414 --> 01:55:54,250
He'll die alone. As will you.

1403
01:55:54,417 --> 01:55:55,710
She's not alone.

1404
01:56:21,944 --> 01:56:23,654
Oh, no, you don't.

1405
01:56:23,821 --> 01:56:25,281
This isn't gonna be like New York, pal.

1406
01:56:25,448 --> 01:56:27,742
This suit's already kicked the crap
outta the Hulk.

1407
01:56:27,909 --> 01:56:28,910
What? No! No!

1408
01:56:32,663 --> 01:56:35,374
Guys! Vision needs backup, now!

1409
01:56:37,376 --> 01:56:40,963
Hulk? Hulk, I know you like
making your entrance at the last second.

1410
01:56:41,130 --> 01:56:43,758
Well, this is it, man.
This is the last, last second.

1411
01:56:48,221 --> 01:56:49,764
Hulk! Hulk!

1412
01:56:50,807 --> 01:56:51,641
Hulk!

1413
01:56:52,809 --> 01:56:54,977
No!

1414
01:56:55,144 --> 01:56:57,897
Oh, screw you, you big, green asshole!

1415
01:56:58,064 --> 01:56:59,232
I'll do it myself!

1416
01:57:00,191 --> 01:57:02,026
Come on! Yeah!

1417
01:57:14,914 --> 01:57:15,957
See ya!

1418
01:57:27,510 --> 01:57:30,012
Hulk, we got a lot to figure out, pal.

1419
01:57:41,065 --> 01:57:42,942
I thought you were formidable, machine.

1420
01:57:43,901 --> 01:57:46,445
But you're dying, like any man.

1421
01:57:55,037 --> 01:57:56,289
Get outta here!

1422
01:57:59,834 --> 01:58:00,751
Go!

1423
01:58:19,479 --> 01:58:21,147
That was really gross.

1424
01:58:48,299 --> 01:58:49,383
I thought I told you to go.

1425
01:58:50,968 --> 01:58:52,929
We don't trade lives, Captain.

1426
01:59:04,148 --> 01:59:06,234
I got you. I got you.

1427
01:59:06,484 --> 01:59:08,486
I'm sorry I can't remember anybody's names.

1428
01:59:53,739 --> 01:59:55,241
You're full of tricks, wizard.

1429
01:59:57,326 --> 02:00:00,246
Yet you never once used your greatest weapon.

1430
02:00:03,666 --> 02:00:04,667
A fake.

1431
02:00:12,633 --> 02:00:16,095
You throw another moon at me,
and I'm gonna lose it.

1432
02:00:16,262 --> 02:00:17,430
Stark.

1433
02:00:17,597 --> 02:00:18,681
You know me?

1434
02:00:19,307 --> 02:00:20,433
I do.

1435
02:00:20,975 --> 02:00:24,103
You're not the only one
cursed with knowledge.

1436
02:00:25,021 --> 02:00:26,355
My only curse is you.

1437
02:00:28,941 --> 02:00:30,492
Come on!

1438
02:00:57,887 --> 02:00:59,847
All that for a drop of blood.

1439
02:01:43,891 --> 02:01:45,685
You have my respect, Stark.

1440
02:01:47,353 --> 02:01:50,523
When I'm done,
half of humanity will still be alive.

1441
02:01:56,070 --> 02:01:58,156
I hope they remember you.

1442
02:02:08,166 --> 02:02:09,083
Stop.

1443
02:02:15,381 --> 02:02:16,382
Spare his life...

1444
02:02:18,176 --> 02:02:19,927
and I will give you the stone.

1445
02:02:23,473 --> 02:02:24,765
No tricks.

1446
02:02:29,562 --> 02:02:30,563
Don't.

1447
02:03:21,989 --> 02:03:23,699
One to go.

1448
02:03:33,584 --> 02:03:35,002
Where is he?

1449
02:03:43,970 --> 02:03:45,346
Did we just lose?

1450
02:03:49,267 --> 02:03:51,185
Why would you do that?

1451
02:03:54,522 --> 02:03:56,774
We're in the endgame now.

1452
02:04:22,717 --> 02:04:24,093
Are you okay?

1453
02:04:26,053 --> 02:04:27,763
What? What is it?

1454
02:04:29,932 --> 02:04:31,058
He's here.

1455
02:04:42,069 --> 02:04:45,114
Everyone, on my position. We have incoming.

1456
02:04:47,867 --> 02:04:49,827
What the hell?

1457
02:05:15,520 --> 02:05:16,354
Cap.

1458
02:05:17,104 --> 02:05:18,564
That's him.

1459
02:05:20,608 --> 02:05:23,194
Eyes up. Stay sharp.

1460
02:05:47,927 --> 02:05:48,761
Wanda.

1461
02:05:49,804 --> 02:05:52,265
- It's time.
- No.

1462
02:05:52,431 --> 02:05:54,642
They can't stop him, Wanda, but we can.

1463
02:05:54,809 --> 02:05:57,562
Look at me. You have the
power to destroy the stone.

1464
02:05:57,728 --> 02:05:59,856
- Don't.
- You must do it. Wanda, please.

1465
02:06:01,858 --> 02:06:04,443
We are out of time.

1466
02:06:05,236 --> 02:06:06,362
I can't.

1467
02:06:06,529 --> 02:06:07,947
Yes, you can.

1468
02:06:08,614 --> 02:06:09,866
You can.

1469
02:06:11,367 --> 02:06:13,661
If he gets the stone, half the universe dies.

1470
02:06:16,038 --> 02:06:17,540
It's not fair.

1471
02:06:18,749 --> 02:06:20,334
It shouldn't be you, but it is.

1472
02:06:22,295 --> 02:06:23,754
It's all right.

1473
02:06:25,173 --> 02:06:26,883
You could never hurt me.

1474
02:06:35,933 --> 02:06:37,727
I just feel you.

1475
02:08:00,852 --> 02:08:01,978
It's all right.

1476
02:08:11,904 --> 02:08:13,239
It's all right.

1477
02:08:17,577 --> 02:08:18,661
I love you.

1478
02:08:47,982 --> 02:08:50,109
I understand, my child.

1479
02:08:51,652 --> 02:08:53,279
Better than anyone.

1480
02:08:54,947 --> 02:08:56,866
You could never.

1481
02:09:01,704 --> 02:09:04,707
Today, I lost more than you can know.

1482
02:09:06,501 --> 02:09:09,128
But now is no time to mourn.

1483
02:09:11,380 --> 02:09:15,384
Now is no time at all.

1484
02:09:38,699 --> 02:09:39,450
No!

1485
02:10:37,675 --> 02:10:39,135
I told you...

1486
02:10:40,511 --> 02:10:42,346
you'd die for that.

1487
02:10:56,694 --> 02:10:58,446
You should have...

1488
02:11:01,073 --> 02:11:02,533
You should...

1489
02:11:05,036 --> 02:11:08,289
You should have gone for the head.

1490
02:11:10,208 --> 02:11:11,209
No!

1491
02:11:44,617 --> 02:11:45,827
Daughter?

1492
02:11:53,459 --> 02:11:54,836
Did you do it?

1493
02:11:56,754 --> 02:11:57,755
Yes.

1494
02:12:06,180 --> 02:12:07,765
What did it cost?

1495
02:12:11,477 --> 02:12:12,979
Everything.

1496
02:12:23,239 --> 02:12:24,782
What did you do?

1497
02:12:26,033 --> 02:12:27,535
What'd you do?

1498
02:12:41,174 --> 02:12:42,550
Where'd he go?

1499
02:12:45,636 --> 02:12:46,554
Thor.

1500
02:12:49,849 --> 02:12:51,476
Where'd he go?

1501
02:12:51,642 --> 02:12:52,894
Steve?

1502
02:13:27,720 --> 02:13:30,014
Up, General. Up!

1503
02:13:30,598 --> 02:13:32,475
This is no place to die.

1504
02:13:47,073 --> 02:13:48,991
I am Groot.

1505
02:13:51,160 --> 02:13:53,246
No, no, no!

1506
02:13:54,080 --> 02:13:56,916
Groot! No.

1507
02:14:10,346 --> 02:14:11,514
Sam!

1508
02:14:15,560 --> 02:14:17,311
Sam, where you at?

1509
02:14:26,529 --> 02:14:28,739
Something's happening.

1510
02:14:40,877 --> 02:14:42,044
Quill?

1511
02:14:49,427 --> 02:14:50,553
Steady, Quill.

1512
02:14:50,720 --> 02:14:51,888
Oh, man.

1513
02:14:56,058 --> 02:14:57,059
Tony.

1514
02:15:00,605 --> 02:15:03,065
There was no other way.

1515
02:15:08,905 --> 02:15:09,739
Mr. Stark?

1516
02:15:14,202 --> 02:15:15,536
I don't feel so good.

1517
02:15:17,788 --> 02:15:19,707
- You're all right.
- I don't know what's happening.

1518
02:15:19,874 --> 02:15:20,791
I don't know...

1519
02:15:23,169 --> 02:15:26,047
I don't want to go.
I don't want to go, sir. Please.

1520
02:15:26,214 --> 02:15:28,925
Please, I don't want to go.
I don't want to go.

1521
02:15:33,471 --> 02:15:34,972
I'm sorry.

1522
02:15:49,821 --> 02:15:51,280
He did it.

1523
02:16:16,055 --> 02:16:19,267
What is this?
What the hell is happening?

1524
02:16:20,995 --> 02:16:35,154

1525
02:16:36,159 --> 02:16:37,910
Oh, God.

1526
02:27:34,192 --> 02:27:35,526
Still no word from Stark?

1527
02:27:35,693 --> 02:27:36,944
No, not yet.

1528
02:27:37,111 --> 02:27:40,364
We're watching every satellite
on both hemispheres, but still nothing.

1529
02:27:41,365 --> 02:27:42,408
What is it?

1530
02:27:42,575 --> 02:27:44,911
Multiple bogeys over Wakanda.

1531
02:27:45,077 --> 02:27:46,996
Same energy signature as New York?

1532
02:27:47,163 --> 02:27:48,498
Ten times bigger.

1533
02:27:49,999 --> 02:27:51,959
- Tell Klein we'll meet him at...
- Nick! Nick!

1534
02:28:05,890 --> 02:28:07,183
They okay?

1535
02:28:08,184 --> 02:28:09,936
There's no one here.

1536
02:28:19,487 --> 02:28:20,988
Call Control.

1537
02:28:21,739 --> 02:28:23,032
Code red.

1538
02:28:23,699 --> 02:28:24,700
Nick.

1539
02:28:26,369 --> 02:28:27,370
Hill.

1540
02:28:42,301 --> 02:28:43,469
Oh, no.

1541
02:28:45,096 --> 02:28:46,097
Mother...
