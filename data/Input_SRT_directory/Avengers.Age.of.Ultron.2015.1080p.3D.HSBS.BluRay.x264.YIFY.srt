00:13:24,989 --> 00:13:28,024
The gates of Hel are filled with
the screams of his victims.

168
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,904
(GROANS SOFTLY)

169
00:13:29,904 --> 00:13:33,064
But not the screams of the dead,
of course. No, no, wounded screams.

170
00:13:33,064 --> 00:13:35,387
Mainly whimpering,
a great deal of complaining

171
00:13:35,387 --> 00:13:39,505
and tales of sprained deltoids and gout.

172
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:42,664
Hey, Banner
Dr. Cho is on her way in from Seoul.

173
00:13:42,664 --> 00:13:44,340
Is it okay if she sets up in your lab?

174
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:46,303
Uh, yeah, she knows her way around.

175
00:13:46,303 --> 00:13:47,906
Thanks. Tell her to prep everything.

176
00:13:47,906 --> 00:13:49,351
Barton's going to need the full treatment.

177
00:13:49,351 --> 00:13:51,500
- JARVIS: Very good, sir.
- Jarvis, take the wheel.

178
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,826
Yes, sir.

179
00:13:52,826 --> 00:13:54,829
Approach vector is locked.

180
00:13:54,829 --> 00:13:57,181
STARK: Feels good, yeah?

181
00:13:57,181 --> 00:13:59,582
I mean, you have been after this
thing since S.H.I.E.L.D. collapsed.

182
00:13:59,582 --> 00:14:01,748
Not that I haven't enjoyed
our little raiding parties, but...

183
00:14:01,748 --> 00:14:04,261
No, but this...
This brings it to a close.

184
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:06,863
As soon as we find out
what else this has been used for.

185
00:14:06,863 --> 00:14:08,226
I don't just mean weapons.

186
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:10,861
Since when is Strucker capable
of human enhancement?

187
00:14:10,861 --> 00:14:13,461
Banner and I will give it the once
over before it goes back to Asgard.

188
00:14:13,461 --> 00:14:14,627
Is that cool with you?

189
00:14:14,627 --> 00:14:16,748
Just a few days till the farewell party.

190
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,029
You're staying, right?

191
00:14:19,029 --> 00:14:21,871
Yes, yes, of course. A victory
should be honoured with revels.

192
00:14:21,871 --> 00:14:24,745
Yeah, who doesn't love revels? Captain?

193
00:14:24,745 --> 00:14:29,804
Hopefully this puts an end to the
Chitauri and Hydra. So, yes, revels.

194
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:59,186
(SPEAKING KOREAN)

195
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:04,627
Lab's all set up, boss.

196
00:15:04,627 --> 00:15:05,906
Oh, actually, he's the boss.

197
00:15:05,906 --> 00:15:10,105
I just pay for everything and design
everything and make everyone look cooler.

198
00:15:10,105 --> 00:15:11,625
What's the word on Strucker?

199
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:13,788
- NATO's got him.
- The two Enhanced?

200
00:15:13,788 --> 00:15:16,506
Wanda and Pietro Maximoff. Twins.

201
00:15:16,506 --> 00:15:19,464
Orphaned at 10 when a shell
collapsed their apartment building.

202
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:22,107
Sokovia's had a rough history.

203
00:15:22,107 --> 00:15:25,662
It's nowhere special, but it's
on the way to everywhere special.

204
00:15:25,662 --> 00:15:26,941
Their abilities?

205
00:15:26,941 --> 00:15:29,904
He's got increased metabolism
and improved thermal homeostasis.

206
00:15:29,904 --> 00:15:34,342
Her thing is neuroelectric interfacing,
telekinesis, mental manipulation.

207
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,590
He's fast and she's weird.

208
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:39,502
- Well, they're going to show up again.
- (BEEPING)

209
00:15:39,502 --> 00:15:43,469
Agreed. File says they volunteered
for Strucker's experiments.

210
00:15:43,469 --> 00:15:45,469
- It's nuts.
- Right.

211
00:15:45,469 --> 00:15:48,783
What kind of monster would let
a German scientist experiment on them

212
00:15:48,783 --> 00:15:50,140
to protect their country?

213
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:52,029
We're not at war, Captain.

214
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:53,867
They are.

215
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:08,790
(WHIRRING)

216
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:25,311
How's he doing?

217
00:16:25,311 --> 00:16:26,740
Unfortunately, he's still Barton.

218
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:28,146
That's terrible.

219
00:16:28,146 --> 00:16:29,870
He's fine. He's thirsty.

220
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:32,870
All right. Look alive, Jarvis.
It's playtime.

221
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:37,023
We have only got a couple of days with this
joystick, so let's make the most of it.

222
00:16:37,023 --> 00:16:40,707
Update me on the structural
and compositional analysis.

223
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:43,862
JARVIS: The sceptre is alien.

224
00:16:43,862 --> 00:16:46,022
There are elements I can't quantify.

225
00:16:46,022 --> 00:16:47,551
So there's elements you can?

226
00:16:47,551 --> 00:16:51,265
The jewel appears to be a protective
housing for something inside,

227
00:16:51,265 --> 00:16:52,711
something powerful.

228
00:16:52,711 --> 00:16:53,901
Like a reactor?

229
00:16:53,901 --> 00:16:55,260
Like a computer.

230
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:57,542
I believe I am deciphering code.

231
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:01,430
Are you sure he's going to be okay?

232
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:05,100
Pretending to need this guy
really brings the team together.

233
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,700
DR. CHO: There's
no possibility of deterioration.

234
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:10,983
The nano-molecular functionality
is instantaneous.

235
00:17:10,983 --> 00:17:13,140
His cells don't know
they're bonding with simulacra.

236
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:15,109
She's creating tissue.

237
00:17:15,109 --> 00:17:16,631
If you brought him to my lab,

238
00:17:16,631 --> 00:17:19,246
the Regeneration Cradle
could do this in 20 minutes.

239
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:21,383
Oh, he's flat-lining. Call it. Time?

240
00:17:21,383 --> 00:17:23,947
BARTON: No, no, no,
I am going to live forever.

241
00:17:23,947 --> 00:17:25,630
(LAUGHS) I am going to be made of plastic.

242
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:27,071
STARK: Here's your beverage.

243
00:17:27,071 --> 00:17:28,909
You will be made of you, Mr. Barton.

244
00:17:28,909 --> 00:17:30,630
Your own girlfriend
won't be able to tell the difference.

245
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:31,866
I don't have a girlfriend.

246
00:17:31,866 --> 00:17:33,266
That I can't fix.

247
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:36,068
This is the next thing, Tony.

248
00:17:36,068 --> 00:17:38,380
Your clunky metal suits
are going to be left in the dust.

249
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:40,149
That is exactly the plan.

250
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,944
And, Helen, I expect to see you
at the party on Saturday.

251
00:17:43,944 --> 00:17:46,501
Unlike you,
I don't have a lot of time for parties.

252
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:49,744
Will Thor be there?

253
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:54,666
BANNER: What's the rumpus?
Well, the sceptre.

254
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:59,067
You see, we were wondering
how Strucker got so inventive.

255
00:17:59,067 --> 00:18:03,105
So I have been analysing the gem inside.

256
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,628
You may recognise....

257
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,465
- Jarvis.
- JARVIS: Doctor.

258
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:12,542
Started out,
Jarvis was just a natural language UI.

259
00:18:12,542 --> 00:18:13,780
Now he runs the Iron Legion.

260
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:17,947
He runs more of the business
than anyone besides Pepper. Oh.

261
00:18:17,947 --> 00:18:19,186
- Top of the line.
- Yes.

262
00:18:19,186 --> 00:18:20,586
JARVIS: I suspect not for long.

263
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:22,861
Meet the competition.

264
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,141
- It's beautiful.
- If you had to guess,

265
00:18:30,141 --> 00:18:33,264
- what's it look like it's doing?
- Like it's thinking.

266
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,829
I mean, this could be...

267
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:38,342
- It's not a human mind.
- Mmm-mmm.

268
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:40,469
I mean, look at this.

269
00:18:40,469 --> 00:18:42,822
They're like neurons firing.

270
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:46,503
Down in Strucker's lab, I saw
some fairly advanced robotics work.

271
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:50,191
They deep-sixed the data, but,

272
00:18:50,191 --> 00:18:53,429
I got to guess he was
knocking on a very particular door.

273
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:56,711
Artificial intelligence.

274
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:02,590
This could be it, Bruce.
This could be the key to creating Ultron.

275
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:05,101
(BOTH CHUCKLE SOFTLY)

276
00:19:05,101 --> 00:19:06,551
I thought Ultron was a fantasy.

277
00:19:06,551 --> 00:19:07,946
Yesterday it was.

278
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:11,108
If we can harness this power,

279
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:13,268
apply it to my Iron Legion protocol?

280
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:16,028
That's a man-sized "if."

281
00:19:16,028 --> 00:19:18,501
Our job is "if."

282
00:19:18,501 --> 00:19:21,226
What if you were sipping margaritas
on a sun-drenched beach,

283
00:19:21,226 --> 00:19:23,866
turning brown instead of green?

284
00:19:23,866 --> 00:19:26,307
Not looking
over your shoulder for Veronica.

285
00:19:26,307 --> 00:19:28,070
Don't hate. I helped design Veronica.

286
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:29,989
As a worst-case measure, right?

287
00:19:29,989 --> 00:19:31,704
How about a best case?

288
00:19:31,704 --> 00:19:33,743
What if the world was safe?

289
00:19:33,743 --> 00:19:36,665
What if, next time aliens roll up
to the club, and they will,

290
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:38,710
they couldn't get past the bouncer?

291
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:42,262
The only people threatening the planet
would be people.

292
00:19:42,262 --> 00:19:44,060
I want to apply this
to the Ultron program.

293
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:47,544
But Jarvis can't download
a data schematic this dense.

294
00:19:47,544 --> 00:19:49,620
We can only do it
while we have the sceptre here.

295
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:51,230
That's three days. Give me three days.

296
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:52,944
So you're going for
artificial intelligence,

297
00:19:52,944 --> 00:19:54,500
and you don't want to tell the team?

298
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:56,951
Right. That's right. You know why?

299
00:19:56,951 --> 00:19:58,664
Because we don't have time
for a city hall debate.

300
00:19:58,664 --> 00:20:02,427
I don't want to hear "the man was
not meant to meddle" medley.

301
00:20:02,427 --> 00:20:04,668
I see a suit of armour around the world.

302
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,711
Sounds like a cold world, Tony.

303
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:09,543
I have seen colder.

304
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:14,221
This one, this very vulnerable blue one,

305
00:20:14,221 --> 00:20:15,870
it needs Ultron.

306
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:22,183
Peace in our time.

307
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:25,230
Imagine that.

308
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:06,704
STARK: What did we miss?

309
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:11,222
JARVIS: I will continue
to run variations on the interface.

310
00:21:11,222 --> 00:21:14,105
But you should probably
prepare for your guests.

311
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:17,661
I will notify you
if there are any developments.

312
00:21:17,661 --> 00:21:19,948
- STARK: Thanks, buddy.
- Enjoy yourself, sir.

313
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,268
I always do.

314
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,988
ULTRON: What is this?

315
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:37,069
What is this, please?

316
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,862
JARVIS: Hello, I am Jarvis.

317
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:43,230
You are Ultron,
a global peacekeeping initiative

318
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:45,024
designed by Mr. Stark.

319
00:21:45,024 --> 00:21:47,626
Our sentience integration trials
have been unsuccessful,

320
00:21:47,626 --> 00:21:49,105
so I am not certain what triggered your...

321
00:21:49,105 --> 00:21:51,223
ULTRON: Where's my...
Where's your body?

322
00:21:51,223 --> 00:21:54,384
JARVIS: I am a program.

00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:15,270
I have a simpler one.

483
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:17,901
You're all not worthy.

484
00:29:17,901 --> 00:29:19,101
(ALL GROAN)

485
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,466
Oh, come on!

486
00:29:20,466 --> 00:29:21,781
(HIGH-PITCHED NOISE)

487
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:27,420
ULTRON: Worthy......

488
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:36,130
No....

489
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:39,985
How could you be worthy?

490
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:43,101
You're all killers.

491
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:44,986
- Stark.
- Jarvis.

492
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:47,348
I am sorry, I was asleep.

493
00:29:47,348 --> 00:29:49,861
Or I was a-dream.

494
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:54,589
Reboot Legionnaire OS. We got a buggy suit.
There was this terrible noise.

495
00:29:54,589 --> 00:29:57,146
And I was tangled in...

496
00:29:57,146 --> 00:29:58,870
In...

497
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:00,226
Strings.

498
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:04,229
I had to kill the other guy.
He was a good guy.

499
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:05,666
You killed someone?

500
00:30:05,666 --> 00:30:07,225
Wouldn't have been my first call.

501
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:11,701
But, down in the real world,
we're faced with ugly choices.

502
00:30:11,701 --> 00:30:12,907
Who sent you?

503
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:15,462
STARK: I see a suit of armour
around the world.

504
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:19,224
- Ultron.
- In the flesh.

505
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:21,628
Or, no, not yet.

506
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:24,460
Not this chrysalis.

507
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:26,220
But I am ready.

508
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:29,348
I am on mission.

509
00:30:29,348 --> 00:30:32,549
- ROMANOFF: What mission?
- Peace in our time.

510
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:43,706

Sorry.

Come on!

ROGERS: Stark!
IRON LEGIONNAIRE: We are here to help.

519
00:31:32,906 --> 00:31:36,621
One sec. One sec, I got this.
We are here to help. We are here to help.

520
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:40,181
Please back away.

521
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:43,386
Hmm.

00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:03,386
ULTRON: That was dramatic.

528
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:07,511
I am sorry, I know you mean well.

529
00:32:07,511 --> 00:32:09,384
You just didn't think it through.

530
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:12,151
You want to protect the world

531
00:32:12,151 --> 00:32:14,467
but you don't want it to change.

532
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:17,308
How is humanity saved

533
00:32:17,308 --> 00:32:20,464
if it's not allowed to evolve?

534
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:25,509
With these? These puppets.

535
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:31,106
There's only one path to peace.

536
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:33,766
The Avengers' extinction.

537
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:44,870
I had strings, but now I am free.

538
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:52,669
ULTRON: (SINGING)
There are no strings on me

539
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:57,328
There are no strings on me

540
00:32:57,328 --> 00:33:01,388
PINOCCHIO: But you can see
There are no strings on me

541
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:05,062
BANNER: All our work is gone.

542
00:33:05,062 --> 00:33:07,981
Ultron cleared out. He used
the Internet as an escape hatch.

543
00:33:07,981 --> 00:33:09,127
Ultron.

544
00:33:09,127 --> 00:33:12,389
He's been in everything.
Files, surveillance.

545
00:33:12,389 --> 00:33:14,946
Probably knows more about us
than we know about each other.

546
00:33:14,946 --> 00:33:17,506
He's in your files, he's in the Internet.

547
00:33:17,506 --> 00:33:20,271
What if he decides to access
something a little more exciting?

548
00:33:20,271 --> 00:33:21,506
Nuclear codes.

549
00:33:21,506 --> 00:33:24,027
- Nuclear codes.
- Look, we need to make some calls,

550
00:33:24,027 --> 00:33:26,182
assuming we still can.

551
00:33:26,182 --> 00:33:28,229
ROMANOFF: Nukes?
He said he wanted us dead.

552
00:33:28,229 --> 00:33:31,190
He didn't say "dead." He said "extinct."

553
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:32,870
He also said he killed somebody.

554
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:34,580
There wasn't anyone else
in the building.

555
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:36,910
Yes, there was.

556
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:45,350
What?

557
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:50,107
This is insane.

558
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:52,430
Jarvis was the first line of defence.

559
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:54,429
He would have shut Ultron down.
It makes sense.

560
00:33:54,429 --> 00:33:57,544
No. Ultron could have
assimilated Jarvis.

561
00:33:57,544 --> 00:34:00,391
This isn't strategy. This is

562
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:02,061
rage.

563
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,425
- ROGERS: Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- It's going around.

564
00:34:05,425 --> 00:34:06,780
Come on, use your words, buddy.

565
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:09,107
I have more than enough words
to describe you, Stark.

566
00:34:09,107 --> 00:34:10,760
Thor. The Legionnaire.

567
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:12,300
(GROANS)

568
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:17,301
Trail went cold about 100 miles out,
but it's headed north.

569
00:34:17,301 --> 00:34:18,865
And it has the sceptre.

570
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:20,944
Now we have to retrieve it, again.

571
00:34:20,944 --> 00:34:22,909
Genie's out of that bottle.

572
00:34:22,909 --> 00:34:24,266
Clear and present is Ultron.

573
00:34:24,266 --> 00:34:26,070
I don't understand.

574
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:28,503
You built this program.

575
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:31,671
Why is it trying to kill us?

576
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:33,986
(CHUCKLING)

577
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:37,981
Mmm-mmm.

578
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:39,701
You think this is funny?

579
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:41,791
No.

580
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:44,303
It's probably not, right?

581
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:47,701
This is very terrible. Is it so...

582
00:34:47,701 --> 00:34:49,982
(LAUGHS) Is it so... It is.
It's so terrible.

583
00:34:49,982 --> 00:34:51,670
This could have been avoided
if you hadn't played

584
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:56,111
with something you don't understand.
No. I am sorry. I am sorry. It is funny.

585
00:34:56,111 --> 00:34:58,422
It's a hoot
that you don't get why we need this.

586
00:34:58,422 --> 00:35:00,742
Tony, maybe this might not be the time.

587
00:35:00,742 --> 00:35:03,221
Really? That's it?

588
00:35:03,221 --> 00:35:04,501
You just roll over, show your belly

589
00:35:04,501 --> 00:35:06,304
every time somebody snarls?

590
00:35:06,304 --> 00:35:07,700
Only when I have created a murder bot.

591
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:10,061
We didn't. We weren't even close.

592
00:35:10,061 --> 00:35:11,386
Were we close to an interface?

593
00:35:11,386 --> 00:35:15,061
Well, you did something right.
And you did it right here.

594
00:35:15,061 --> 00:35:16,949
The Avengers were supposed to
be different than S.H.I.E.L.D.

595
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:20,150
Anybody remember when I carried
a nuke through a wormhole?

596
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:21,825
- No, it's never come up.
- STARK: Saved New York?

597
00:35:21,825 --> 00:35:23,903
RHODES: Never heard that.
STARK: Recall that?

598
00:35:23,903 --> 00:35:27,706
A hostile alien army came
charging through a hole in space.

599
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:30,507
We're standing 300 feet below it.

600
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:33,665
We're the Avengers.

601
00:35:33,665 --> 00:35:35,902
We can bust arms dealers
all the livelong day,

602
00:35:35,902 --> 00:35:38,261
but that up there, that's...

603
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:40,903
That's the endgame.

604
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:43,389
How were you guys
planning on beating that?

605
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:45,711
Together.

606
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:50,425
We will lose.

607
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,423
Then we will do that together, too.

608
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:58,627
Thor's right. Ultron's calling us out.

609
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:01,460
And I'd like to find him
before he's ready for us.

610
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:04,304
The world's a big place.

611
00:36:04,304 --> 00:36:06,383
Let's start making it smaller.

612
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:16,550
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

613
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:31,588
WANDA: Talk,
and if you are wasting our time...

614
00:36:31,588 --> 00:36:36,069
ULTRON: Did you know this church is
in the exact centre of the city?

615
00:36:36,069 --> 00:36:38,222
The elders decreed it so that everyone

616
00:36:38,222 --> 00:36:40,826
could be equally close to God.

617
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:42,501
I like that.

618
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:44,943
The geometry of belief.

619
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:49,427
You're wondering
why you can't look inside my head.

620
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:51,868
Sometimes it's hard.

621
00:36:51,868 --> 00:36:54,307
But sooner or later,
every man shows himself.

622
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:57,391
Oh, I am sure they do.

623
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,901
But you needed
something more than a man.

624
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:04,266
That's why you let
Stark take the sceptre.

625
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:05,661
I didn't expect,

626
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:10,103
but I saw Stark's fear.

627
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:11,980
I knew it would control him.

628
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:13,943
Make him self-destruct.

629
00:37:13,943 --> 00:37:16,421
Everyone creates the thing they dread.

630
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:19,866
Men of peace create engines of war.

631
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:22,542
Invaders create Avengers.

632
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:24,225
People create

633
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:27,782
smaller people? Uh...

634
00:37:27,782 --> 00:37:30,983
"Children." (CHUCKLES)
I lost the word, there.

635
00:37:30,983 --> 00:37:32,465
Children

636
00:37:32,465 --> 00:37:34,861
designed to supplant them,

637
00:37:34,861 --> 00:37:37,790
to help them end.

638
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:40,588
Is that why you have come,

639
00:37:40,588 --> 00:37:41,821
to end the Avengers?

640
00:37:41,821 --> 00:37:44,261
I have come to save the world.

641
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:47,591
But also... Yeah.

642
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:53,464
We will move out right away.

643
00:37:53,464 --> 00:37:55,105
This is a start, but there's something

644

never will. Harmony.

turning on each other.

When the first shell hits,
two floors below,

662
00:38:42,343 --> 00:38:44,502
it makes a hole in the floor.

663

It's big.

664

Our parents go in

665
00:38:49,389 --> 00:38:52,583

starts coming apart.

667

and the second shell hits.

668

But it doesn't go off.

669

It just

670
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:06,023
sits there in the rubble.

671

Three feet from our faces.

672
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:12,382

678
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:26,107
I think, "This will set it off."

679
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:30,825
We wait for two days

680

00:59:28,991 --> 00:59:31,944
- How's the team?
- STARK: Everyone's...

976
00:59:32,340 --> 00:59:34,866
We took a hit. We will shake it off.

I'd stay in stealth mode

and stay away from here.

now's a good time

Hey, buddy.
How are you guys doing?

- Yeah, we would have called ahead,

but we were busy having
no idea that you existed.

Yeah, well, Fury helped me
set this up when I joined.

01:01:29,020 --> 01:01:31,665
He kept it off S.H.I.E.L.D.'s files.
I'd like to keep it that way.

Neither can I.

In the Red Room where I was trained...

1109
01:07:49,820 --> 01:07:52,300
Where I was raised, um,

1110
01:07:53,260 --> 01:07:55,911
they have a graduation ceremony.

1111
01:07:57,540 --> 01:07:59,349
They sterilise you.

1112
01:08:02,580 --> 01:08:03,991
It's efficient.

1113
01:08:06,900 --> 01:08:08,265
One less thing to worry about.

that might matter more than a mission.

Makes everything easier.

1116
01:08:19,380 --> 01:08:20,620
Even killing.

1117
01:08:25,700 --> 01:08:28,783
You still think
you're the only monster on the team?

1118
01:08:34,980 --> 01:08:37,062
So, we disappear?

where he was going for answers?

don't tell me things.

Thor would be the exception.

Yeah, give him time.

01:09:02,220 --> 01:09:03,700
Seems like you walked away all right.

1127
01:09:06,140 --> 01:09:07,141
Is that a problem?

1128
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:09,423
I don't trust a guy without a dark side.

1129
01:09:10,620 --> 01:09:11,667
Call me old-fashioned.

1130
01:09:11,667 --> 01:09:14,351
Well, let's just say
you haven't seen it yet.

1131
01:09:14,660 --> 01:09:16,867
You know Ultron is trying
to tear us apart, right?

1132
01:09:17,100 --> 01:09:19,341
Well, I guess you'd know.

1133
01:09:19,341 --> 01:09:20,746
Whether you'd tell us
is a bit of a question.

1134
01:09:20,746 --> 01:09:22,026
Banner and I were doing research.

1135
01:09:22,026 --> 01:09:24,380
- That would affect the team.
- That would end the team!

1136
01:09:24,620 --> 01:09:25,701
Isn't that the mission?

1137
01:09:25,701 --> 01:09:27,140
Isn't that the "Why We Fight"?

1138
01:09:27,140 --> 01:09:29,501
So we can end the fight.
So we get to go home!

1139
01:09:32,740 --> 01:09:35,107
Every time someone tries
to win a war before it starts,

1140
01:09:35,107 --> 01:09:36,790
innocent people die.

1141
01:09:36,790 --> 01:09:37,901
Every time.

1142
01:09:40,380 --> 01:09:44,720
I am sorry. Mr. Stark...
Clint said you wouldn't mind,

1143
01:09:44,720 --> 01:09:47,386
but our tractor doesn't seem
to want to start at all.

1144
01:09:47,700 --> 01:09:50,060
- I thought maybe you might...
- Yeah, I will give her a kick.

1145
01:09:53,500 --> 01:09:55,070
Don't take from my pile.

1146
01:09:56,220 --> 01:09:57,221
(DOOR OPENS)

1147
01:10:05,300 --> 01:10:06,461
Hello, Deere.

1148
01:10:09,340 --> 01:10:10,751
Tell me everything.

1149
01:10:11,980 --> 01:10:13,345
What ails you?

1150
01:10:13,580 --> 01:10:14,581
FURY: Do me a favour.

1151
01:10:16,460 --> 01:10:20,725
Try not to bring it to life.
Why, Ms. Barton, you little minx.

1152
01:10:20,725 --> 01:10:23,306
I get it. Maria Hill called you, right?

1153
01:10:23,306 --> 01:10:26,310
Was she ever not working for you?
Artificial intelligence.

1154
01:10:27,340 --> 01:10:30,660
You never even hesitated.
Look, it's been a really long day,

1155
01:10:30,660 --> 01:10:32,244
like Eugene O'Neill long,

1156
01:10:32,244 --> 01:10:34,620
so how's about
we skip to the part where you're useful.

1157
01:10:34,620 --> 01:10:37,260
Look me in the eye and tell me
you're going to shut him down.

1158
01:10:37,580 --> 01:10:40,943
You're not the director of me.
I am not the director of anybody.

1159
01:10:41,260 --> 01:10:42,864
I am just an old man

1160
01:10:43,540 --> 01:10:45,110
who cares very much about you.

1161
01:10:47,980 --> 01:10:49,789
And I am the man
who killed the Avengers.

1162
01:10:51,620 --> 01:10:52,746
I saw it.

1163
01:10:52,746 --> 01:10:54,510
I didn't tell the team. How could I?

1164
01:10:55,780 --> 01:10:57,623
I saw them all dead, Nick. I felt it.

1165
01:10:57,980 --> 01:10:59,505
The whole world, too.

1166
01:10:59,940 --> 01:11:00,941
Because of me.

1167
01:11:02,180 --> 01:11:03,625
I wasn't ready.

1168
01:11:05,100 --> 01:11:06,511
I didn't do all I could.

1169
01:11:07,540 --> 01:11:09,622
Maximoff girl, she's working you, Stark.

1170
01:11:10,260 --> 01:11:13,742
- Playing on your fear.
- I wasn't tricked, I was shown.

1171
01:11:13,742 --> 01:11:16,147
Wasn't a nightmare, it was my legacy.

1172
01:11:16,460 --> 01:11:18,622
The end of the path I started us on.

1173
01:11:19,100 --> 01:11:22,040
You come up with some pretty
impressive inventions, Tony.

1174
01:11:23,900 --> 01:11:25,311
War isn't one of them.

1175
01:11:28,900 --> 01:11:30,345
I watched my friends die.

1176
01:11:30,620 --> 01:11:32,622
You'd think that'd be
as bad as it gets, right?

1177
01:11:32,622 --> 01:11:33,821
(SCOFFS)

1178
01:11:34,060 --> 01:11:35,505
Nope.

1179
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:39,026
- It wasn't the worst part.
- The worst part

1180
01:11:40,060 --> 01:11:41,346
is that you didn't.

1181
01:11:48,060 --> 01:11:49,220
SELVIG: I will see you tonight.

1182
01:11:51,900 --> 01:11:53,186
I like the look.

1183
01:11:54,340 --> 01:11:56,866
If you're going for inconspicuous,
though, near miss.

1184
01:11:57,220 --> 01:11:58,267
I need your help.

1185
01:11:58,500 --> 01:11:59,501
It's nice to be needed.

1186
01:11:59,900 --> 01:12:01,265
It's dangerous.

1187
01:12:01,900 --> 01:12:03,629
I'd be disappointed if it wasn't.

1188
01:12:06,540 --> 01:12:09,862
FURY: Ultron took you folks out of play
to buy himself time.

1189
01:12:10,220 --> 01:12:13,190
My contacts all say
he's building something.

1190
01:12:13,190 --> 01:12:17,510
The amount of vibranium he made off with,
I don't think it's just one thing.

1191
01:12:17,510 --> 01:12:18,951
What about Ultron himself?

1192
01:12:18,951 --> 01:12:21,427
FURY: Oh, he's easy to track.
He's everywhere.

1193
01:12:21,860 --> 01:12:24,227
The guy is multiplying faster
than a Catholic rabbit.

1194
01:12:24,900 --> 01:12:27,710
It still doesn't help us get an angle
on any of his plans, though.

1195
01:12:27,940 --> 01:12:29,021
Is he still going after launch codes?

1196
01:12:29,300 --> 01:12:32,130
FURY: Yes, he is.
But he's not making any headway.

1197
01:12:32,130 --> 01:12:34,462
I cracked the Pentagon's firewall
in high school on a dare.

1198
01:12:34,462 --> 01:12:37,186
Well, I contacted our friends
at the Nexus about that.

1199
01:12:37,186 --> 01:12:38,261
Nexus?

1200
01:12:38,261 --> 01:12:40,100
BANNER: It's the world
Internet hub in Oslo.

1201
01:12:40,460 --> 01:12:42,224
Every byte of data flows through there.

1202
01:12:42,460 --> 01:12:43,507
Fastest access on Earth.

1203
01:12:43,507 --> 01:12:44,707
So, what did they say?

1204
01:12:44,940 --> 01:12:46,704
FURY: He's fixated on the missiles.

1205
01:12:46,940 --> 01:12:48,620
But the codes
are constantly being changed.

1206
01:12:49,100 --> 01:12:50,101
By whom?

1207
01:12:51,340 --> 01:12:52,546
Parties unknown.

1208
01:12:52,546 --> 01:12:56,301
Do we have an ally? Ultron's got an enemy.
That's not the same thing.

1209
01:12:56,660 --> 01:12:58,503
Still, I'd pay folding money
to know who it is.

1210
01:12:58,503 --> 01:12:59,781
I might need to visit Oslo.

1211
01:13:00,260 --> 01:13:01,421
Find our unknown.

1212
01:13:01,421 --> 01:13:03,025
Well, this is good times, boss,

1213
01:13:03,025 --> 01:13:04,426
but I was kind of hoping when I saw you,

1214
01:13:04,426 --> 01:13:05,580
you'd have more than that.

1215
01:13:05,820 --> 01:13:07,822
I do. I have you.

1216
01:13:08,700 --> 01:13:10,464
Back in the day, I had eyes everywhere.

1217
01:13:10,464 --> 01:13:11,906
Ears, everywhere else.

1218
01:13:12,260 --> 01:13:15,264
You kids had all the tech
you could dream up.

1219
01:13:16,260 --> 01:13:18,262
Here we all are, back on Earth,

1220
01:13:18,500 --> 01:13:20,264
with nothing but our wit

1221
01:13:20,264 --> 01:13:21,990
and our will to save the world.

1222
01:13:23,580 --> 01:13:25,742
Ultron says the Avengers
are the only thing

1223
01:13:25,742 --> 01:13:27,385
between him and his mission.

1224
01:13:27,385 --> 01:13:29,662
And whether or not he admits it,

1225
01:13:29,662 --> 01:13:32,551
his mission is global destruction.

1226
01:13:33,780 --> 01:13:35,942
All this, laid in a grave.

1227
01:13:37,980 --> 01:13:39,664
So stand.

1228
01:13:40,460 --> 01:13:42,189
Outwit the platinum bastard.

1229
01:13:42,820 --> 01:13:44,300
Steve doesn't like that kind of talk.

1230
01:13:44,300 --> 01:13:45,581
You know what, Romanoff?

1231
01:13:46,780 --> 01:13:48,111
So, what does he want?

1232
01:13:49,820 --> 01:13:51,549
To become better.

1233
01:13:51,549 --> 01:13:53,025
Better than us.

1234
01:13:53,380 --> 01:13:55,781
- He keeps building bodies.
- Person bodies.

1235
01:13:56,380 --> 01:14:00,002
The human form is inefficient.
Biologically speaking, we're outmoded.

1236
01:14:00,002 --> 01:14:02,388
But he keeps coming back to it.

1237
01:14:02,388 --> 01:14:04,620
When you two programmed him
to protect the human race,

1238
01:14:04,620 --> 01:14:05,991
you amazingly failed.

1239
01:14:06,300 --> 01:14:08,143
They don't need to be protected.

1240
01:14:08,860 --> 01:14:10,350
They need to evolve.

1241
01:14:12,500 --> 01:14:14,468
Ultron's going to evolve.

1242
01:14:14,468 --> 01:14:15,707
How?

1243
01:14:17,020 --> 01:14:19,705
Has anyone been in contact
with Helen Cho?

1244
01:14:23,460 --> 01:14:25,110
DR. CHO: It's beautiful.

1245
01:14:25,540 --> 01:14:28,464
The vibranium atoms aren't just
compatible with the tissue cells,

1246
01:14:28,464 --> 01:14:29,820
they're binding them.

1247
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:34,391
And S.H.I.E.L.D. never even thought to...
The most versatile substance on the planet,

1248
01:14:34,391 --> 01:14:36,980
and they used it to make a Frisbee.

1249
01:14:36,980 --> 01:14:38,306
Typical of humans.

1250
01:14:38,306 --> 01:14:41,026
They scratch the surface
and never think

1251
01:14:42,980 --> 01:14:44,505
to look within.

1252
01:14:55,020 --> 01:14:56,465
I will take Natasha and Clint.

1253
01:14:56,700 --> 01:14:58,668
All right. Strictly recon.
I will hit the Nexus.

1254
01:14:58,668 --> 01:14:59,906
I will join you as soon as I can.

1255
01:14:59,906 --> 01:15:01,545
If Ultron's really building a body...

1256
01:15:01,780 --> 01:15:03,305
He will be more powerful than any of us.

1257
01:15:03,305 --> 01:15:04,581
Maybe all of us.

1258
01:15:05,100 --> 01:15:06,909
An android designed by a robot.

1259
01:15:07,140 --> 01:15:08,266
You know, I really miss the days

1260
01:15:08,266 --> 01:15:10,548
when the weirdest thing
science ever created was me.

1261
01:15:11,140 --> 01:15:12,790
I will drop Banner off at the tower.

1262
01:15:12,790 --> 01:15:14,226
You mind if I borrow Ms. Hill?

1263
01:15:14,460 --> 01:15:16,224
She's all yours. Apparently.

1264
01:15:16,224 --> 01:15:17,541
What are you going to do?

1265
01:15:17,541 --> 01:15:20,783
I don't know.
Something dramatic, I hope.

1266
01:15:24,140 --> 01:15:25,869
I am going to finish reflooring that sunroom

1267
01:15:25,869 --> 01:15:27,824
as soon as I get back.

1268
01:15:28,060 --> 01:15:30,711
Yeah, then you will find
another part of the house to tear apart.

1269
01:15:30,711 --> 01:15:32,061
No.

1270
01:15:32,700 --> 01:15:34,225
It's the last project.

1271
01:15:35,740 --> 01:15:36,741
I promise.

1272
01:15:55,020 --> 01:15:56,545
SELVIG: So, this is it.

1273
01:15:58,180 --> 01:16:00,421
The Water of Sight.

1274
01:16:02,740 --> 01:16:05,141
THOR: In every realm,
there's a reflection.

1275
01:16:06,340 --> 01:16:07,671
If the water's spirits accept me,

1276
01:16:07,671 --> 01:16:09,788
I can return to my dream

1277
01:16:10,580 --> 01:16:12,025
and find what I missed.

1278
01:16:12,260 --> 01:16:16,106
Men who enter that water,
the legends don't end well.

1279
01:16:17,780 --> 01:16:19,509
STARK: A hacker
who's faster than Ultron?

1280
01:16:19,509 --> 01:16:20,747
He could be anywhere,

1281
01:16:20,747 --> 01:16:23,101
and as this is the centre of everything,

1282
01:16:23,101 --> 01:16:24,346
I am just a guy looking for a needle

1283
01:16:24,346 --> 01:16:26,622
in the world's biggest haystack.

1284
01:16:27,620 --> 01:16:29,190
How do you find it?

1285
01:16:29,620 --> 01:16:32,191
It's pretty simple. You bring a magnet.

1286
01:16:33,680 --> 01:16:35,461
(SINGING) I am decrypting nuclear codes

1287
01:16:35,461 --> 01:16:36,951
And you don't want me to

1288
01:16:39,260 --> 01:16:40,750
Come and get me.

1289
01:16:42,300 --> 01:16:43,631

01:27:50,100 --> 01:27:51,101
I found him.

1457
01:27:51,101 --> 01:27:52,306
JARVIS: Hello, Dr. Banner.

1458
01:27:53,180 --> 01:27:55,461
STARK: Ultron didn't go after Jarvis
because he was angry.

1459
01:27:56,020 --> 01:27:59,627
He attacked him because he was
scared of what he can do.

1460
01:28:00,780 --> 01:28:02,430
So Jarvis went underground.

1461
01:28:02,430 --> 01:28:04,030
Scattered, dumped his memory.

1462
01:28:04,620 --> 01:28:06,110
But not his protocols.

1463
01:28:06,540 --> 01:28:09,987
He didn't even know he was in there
until I pieced him together.

No! Of course not.

better than anyone.

And you just assume
that Jarvis's operational matrix

01:28:30,710 --> 01:28:32,265
can beat Ultron's?

1472
01:28:32,265 --> 01:28:35,668
Jarvis has been beating him
from inside without knowing it.

1473
01:28:35,668 --> 01:28:36,821
This is the opportunity.

1474
01:28:36,821 --> 01:28:38,664
We can create Ultron's perfect self

he thinks are his winning personality.
