1
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:27,367
I feel like you're driving me to court martial. This is crazy

2
00:01:27,534 --> 00:01:30,286
What did I do? I feel like you're gonna pull over and snuff me

3
00:01:30,495 --> 00:01:32,872
What, you're not allowed to talk? Hey, Forest...

4
00:01:33,039 --> 00:01:36,041
- We can talk, sir. - Oh, I see. So it's personal?

5
00:01:36,208 --> 00:01:37,792
No, you intimidate them

6
00:01:38,001 --> 00:01:40,921
Dear God, you're a woman! I honestly, I couldn't have called that

7
00:01:41,088 --> 00:01:43,673
I mean, I would apologize, but isn't that what we're going for here?

8
00:01:43,883 --> 00:01:46,260
I thought of you as a soldier first. - I'm an airman

9
00:01:46,468 --> 00:01:49,470
Well you have actually excellent bone structure there. I'm kinda...

10
00:01:49,679 --> 00:01:52,473
having a hard time not looking at you now. Is that weird?

11
00:01:52,682 --> 00:01:54,475
C'mon, it's OK, laugh. Hey!

12
00:01:54,684 --> 00:01:57,061
- Sir, I have a question to ask. - Yes, please

13
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:00,481
It is true you went 12-for-12 with last year's Maxim cover models?

14
00:02:00,731 --> 00:02:02,315
That is an excellent question

15
00:02:02,524 --> 00:02:04,942
Yes and no. March and I had a scheduling conflict

16
00:02:05,152 --> 00:02:08,488
but fortunately the Christmas cover was twins. Anything else?

17
00:02:08,905 --> 00:02:10,614
You're kidding me with a hand up, right?

18
00:02:10,908 --> 00:02:12,909
Is it cool if I take a picture with you?

19
00:02:13,118 --> 00:02:14,786
Yes, it's very cool

20
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:21,500
I don't wanna see this on your MySpace page

21
00:02:21,709 --> 00:02:23,252
Please, no gang signs

22
00:02:23,461 --> 00:02:24,962
No, throw it up, I'm kidding

23
00:02:25,171 --> 00:02:28,173
Yeah, peace! I love peace. I'd be outta job with peace

24
00:02:28,465 --> 00:02:32,218
C'mon! Just click it, don't change the settings, just click it

25
00:02:37,682 --> 00:02:39,391
What's going on?

26
00:02:42,687 --> 00:02:44,897
Jimmy, stay with Stark!

27
00:02:45,106 --> 00:02:46,482
Lie down!

28
00:02:52,279 --> 00:02:53,780
Son of a bitch!

29
00:02:55,449 --> 00:02:58,284
- Wait, wait, give me a gun! - Stay here!

30
00:04:18,109 --> 00:04:19,568
Tony Stark

31
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:25,448
Visionary. Genius. American patriot

32
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:27,950
Even from an early age

33
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,537
the son of legendary weapons developer Howard Stark

34
00:04:30,745 --> 00:04:33,789
quickly stole the spotlight with his brilliant and unique mind

35
00:04:33,998 --> 00:04:37,042
At age four, he built his first circuit board

36
00:04:37,293 --> 00:04:40,045
At age six, his first engine

37
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:44,257
And at seventeen, he graduated Summa Cum Laude from MIT

38
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:47,928
Then, the passing of a titan

39
00:04:48,929 --> 00:04:51,931
Howard Stark's life long friend and ally Obadiah Stane

40
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:55,267
steps in to help fill the gap left by the legendary founder

41
00:04:55,435 --> 00:04:58,604
Until at age 21, the prodigal son returns

42
00:04:58,771 --> 00:05:02,023
and is anointed the new CEO of Stark Industries

43
00:05:02,233 --> 00:05:05,277
With the keys to the kingdom, Tony ushers in a new era

44
00:05:05,486 --> 00:05:08,196
for his father's legacy, creating smarter weapons

45
00:05:08,405 --> 00:05:10,782
advanced robotics, satellite targeting

46
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:14,659
Today, Tony Stark has changed the face of the weapons industry

47
00:05:14,827 --> 00:05:16,412
by ensuring freedom

48
00:05:16,621 --> 00:05:20,499
and protecting America and her interests around the globe

49
00:05:28,716 --> 00:05:31,218
As liaison to Stark Industries

50
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:35,346
I've had the unique privilege of serving with a real patriot

51
00:05:35,555 --> 00:05:39,099
He is my friend and he is my great mentor

52
00:05:39,517 --> 00:05:42,102
Ladies and gentlemen, it is my honor

53
00:05:42,311 --> 00:05:46,357
to present this year's Apogee Award to Mr. Tony Stark!

54
00:05:53,405 --> 00:05:55,281
Tony?

55
00:06:07,126 --> 00:06:09,169
Thank you, Colonel

56
00:06:09,878 --> 00:06:12,296
This is beautiful. Thank you

57
00:06:12,506 --> 00:06:15,508
Thank you all very much. This is wonderful

58
00:06:16,927 --> 00:06:19,554
Well, I'm not Tony Stark

59
00:06:20,722 --> 00:06:22,723
But if I were Tony...

60
00:06:23,141 --> 00:06:26,143
...I would tell you how honored I feel

61
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:30,772
and what a joy it is to receive this very prestigious award

62
00:06:31,482 --> 00:06:34,901
Tony, you know, the best thing about Tony...

63
00:06:35,069 --> 00:06:38,488
...is also the worst thing - he's always working

64
00:06:43,076 --> 00:06:44,535
C'mon!

65
00:06:46,955 --> 00:06:48,956
We should just stay till the morning

66
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:52,585
- You are unbelievable! - Oh, no. They roped you into this?

67
00:06:52,752 --> 00:06:55,379
Nobody roped me into anything. But they told me...

68
00:06:55,588 --> 00:06:58,131
that if I presented you with an award, you'd be deeply honored

69
00:06:58,299 --> 00:07:00,509
Of course I'd be deeply honored. And it's you!

70
00:07:00,718 --> 00:07:03,553
That's great. So when do we do it? One more round. - There you go

71
00:07:03,762 --> 00:07:06,097
There it is. That was easy. I'm so sorry. - Yeah, it's OK

72
00:07:06,306 --> 00:07:08,683
Wow, would you look at that? That's... that's something else

73
00:07:08,892 --> 00:07:11,477
I don't have any of those swooping around. All right, ride!

74
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:15,855
Give me a hand, will you? OK, you too

75
00:07:16,273 --> 00:07:18,484
I don't blow on man's hands

76
00:07:18,651 --> 00:07:21,028
There it is! It's the Lieutenant Colonel Rhodes' roll, and...

77
00:07:21,237 --> 00:07:22,863
That's what happens

78
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:25,240
Worse things have happened, I think we're gonna be fine

79
00:07:25,449 --> 00:07:27,158
Color me up, will you? - This is where I exit

80
00:07:27,367 --> 00:07:29,410
- Tomorrow don't be late. - Yeah, you can count on it

81
00:07:29,619 --> 00:07:31,120
- I'm serious. - I know, I know

82
00:07:31,288 --> 00:07:34,457
Render unto Caesar that which is Caesar's. There you go

83
00:07:39,086 --> 00:07:41,296
Mr. Stark! Excuse me! Mr. Stark!

84
00:07:41,505 --> 00:07:43,840
Christine Everheart, Vanity Fair magazine

85
00:07:44,049 --> 00:07:45,675
Can I ask you a couple of questions? - She's cute

86
00:07:45,884 --> 00:07:47,844
- She's alright? Hi. - Hi

87
00:07:48,053 --> 00:07:49,680
Yeah. Okay, go

88
00:07:49,889 --> 00:07:52,766
You've been called the Da Vinci of our time. What do you say to that?

89
00:07:52,933 --> 00:07:54,684
Absolutely ridiculous. I don't paint

90
00:07:54,893 --> 00:07:57,895
And what do you say to your other nickname, the Merchant of Death?

91
00:07:58,104 --> 00:08:01,732
That's not bad. Let me guess... Berkeley?

92
00:08:01,941 --> 00:08:03,317
Brown, actually

93
00:08:03,526 --> 00:08:05,319
Well, Ms. Brown

94
00:08:05,528 --> 00:08:08,155
It's an imperfect world, but it's the only one we've got

95
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:10,906
I guarantee you the day weapons are no longer needed to keep the peace

96
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:13,284
we'll start making bricks and beams for baby hospitals

97
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:14,327
Rehearse that much?

98
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,328
Every night in front of the mirror before bedtime

99
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,581
- I can see that. - I'd like to show you firsthand

100
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:20,833
All I want is the serious answer

101
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:23,043
Okay, here is serious. My old man had a philosophy:

102
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:25,796
"Peace means having a bigger stick than the other guy. "

103
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:28,048
That's a great line, coming from a guy selling the sticks

104
00:08:28,215 --> 00:08:30,925
My father helped defeat Nazis. He worked on the Manhattan Project

105
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:33,345
A lot of people, including your professors at Brown

106
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:34,930
would call that being a hero

107
00:08:35,138 --> 00:08:37,139
And a lot of people would also call that war-profiteering

108
00:08:37,349 --> 00:08:38,725
Tell me, do you plan to report

109
00:08:38,933 --> 00:08:41,435
on the millions we've saved by advancing medical technology?

110
00:08:41,644 --> 00:08:44,104
Or kept from starvation with our intelli-crops?

111
00:08:44,313 --> 00:08:47,524
All those breakthroughs: military funding, honey

112
00:08:47,941 --> 00:08:50,944
Wow, did you ever lose an hour of sleep your whole life?

113
00:08:51,112 --> 00:08:53,739
I'd be prepared to lose a few with you

114
00:09:06,834 --> 00:09:08,668
Good morning. It's 7 a. m

115
00:09:08,836 --> 00:09:12,297
The weather in Malibu is 72 degrees with scattered clouds

116
00:09:12,506 --> 00:09:15,341
The surf conditions are fair with waist to shoulder highlines

117
00:09:15,509 --> 00:09:18,303
high tide will be at 10:52 a. m

118
00:09:35,569 --> 00:09:38,780
Tony? Hey, Tony!

119
00:10:01,302 --> 00:10:03,887
You are not authorized to access this area. - Jesus!

120
00:10:04,096 --> 00:10:06,598
That's Jarvis, he runs the house

121
00:10:06,807 --> 00:10:09,225
I've got your clothes here, they've been dry cleaned and pressed

122
00:10:09,434 --> 00:10:11,435
And there's a car waiting for you outside

123
00:10:11,644 --> 00:10:13,645
that will take you anywhere you'd like to go

124
00:10:14,021 --> 00:10:17,732
You must be the famous Pepper Potts. - Indeed I am

125
00:10:18,901 --> 00:10:22,530
After all these years, Tony still has you picking up the dry cleaning?

126
00:10:23,114 --> 00:10:26,158
I do anything and everything that Mr. Stark requires

127
00:10:26,367 --> 00:10:30,120
Including occasionally taking out the trash. Would that be all?

128
00:10:47,469 --> 00:10:49,262
Give me the exploded view

129
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:52,223
The compression in cylinder 3 appears to be low

130
00:10:52,933 --> 00:10:54,726
Note that

131
00:10:57,646 --> 00:10:59,647
- I'll try again later... - Please don't turn down my music

132
00:10:59,773 --> 00:11:01,065
I'll keep you posted

133
00:11:01,274 --> 00:11:03,359
You are supposed to be half way around the world right now

134
00:11:03,568 --> 00:11:05,152
- How did she take it? - Like a champ

135
00:11:05,361 --> 00:11:06,820
Might've tried to hustle me out of here

136
00:11:06,987 --> 00:11:08,821
Your flight was scheduled to leave an hour and a half ago

137
00:11:08,989 --> 00:11:10,823
That's funny... I thought with it being my plane and all

138
00:11:11,033 --> 00:11:12,325
that it would just wait for me to get there

139
00:11:12,534 --> 00:11:14,952
I need to speak to you about couple of things before I get you outta the door

140
00:11:15,161 --> 00:11:17,746
I mean, doesn't it kind of defeat the purpose of having your own plane

141
00:11:17,956 --> 00:11:19,248
if it departs before you arrive?

142
00:11:19,457 --> 00:11:22,042
Larry called, he's got another buyer for the Jackson Pollock

143
00:11:22,209 --> 00:11:24,378
in the wings, do you want it, yes or no?

144
00:11:24,588 --> 00:11:27,090
Is it a good representation of his Spring Period?

145
00:11:27,298 --> 00:11:29,716
No the "Springs" is actually the neighborhood in East Hampton

146
00:11:29,926 --> 00:11:32,511
where he lived and worked, not "spring" like the season

147
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,721
I think it's a fair example...

148
00:11:35,055 --> 00:11:37,515
I think it's incredibly overpriced

149
00:11:37,849 --> 00:11:40,226
I need it. Buy it, store it

150
00:11:41,269 --> 00:11:43,562
Okay... the MIT commencement speech

151
00:11:43,771 --> 00:11:46,023
Is in June... please, don't harangue me about that stuff

152
00:11:46,232 --> 00:11:48,984
Well, they are haranguing me, so I'm gonna say yes...

153
00:11:49,193 --> 00:11:51,862
I need you to sign this before you get on the plane

154
00:11:52,029 --> 00:11:53,990
What are you trying to get rid of me for? What, you got plans?

155
00:11:54,198 --> 00:11:56,700
- As a matter of fact, I do. - I don't like it when you have plans

156
00:11:56,909 --> 00:11:58,910
I'm allowed to have plans on my birthday

157
00:11:59,119 --> 00:12:02,288
It's your birthday. - Yes. - I knew that. Already?

158
00:12:02,456 --> 00:12:05,667
Yeah, isn't that strange, it's the same day as last year

159
00:12:06,084 --> 00:12:09,211
Well, get yourself something nice from me. - I already did

160
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:11,630
- And? - Oh, it was very nice

161
00:12:12,506 --> 00:12:15,592
Very tasteful. Thank you, Mr. Stark

162
00:12:15,884 --> 00:12:18,469
You're welcome, Ms. Potts

163
00:12:40,866 --> 00:12:44,577
You're good! I thought I've lost you back there

164
00:12:44,745 --> 00:12:46,788
You did, sir

165
00:12:47,288 --> 00:12:50,290
I took it across Mojave. - Ah, I gotcha, I gotcha

166
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,710
What's wrong with you? - What?

167
00:12:52,918 --> 00:12:55,546
Three hours! - I got caught doing a piece for Vanity Fair

168
00:12:55,755 --> 00:12:57,965
Three hours. For three hours, you got me standing here

169
00:12:58,216 --> 00:13:00,843
I'm waiting on you now. Lets go. C'mon

170
00:13:01,052 --> 00:13:03,470
Wheels up! Rock and roll!

171
00:13:11,228 --> 00:13:13,605
What're you reading? - Nothing

172
00:13:13,813 --> 00:13:16,065
C'mon, sourpatch, don't be mad

173
00:13:16,274 --> 00:13:18,734
I told you I'm not mad, I'm indifferent, okay?

174
00:13:18,943 --> 00:13:20,736
- I said I was sorry. - Good morning, Mr. Stark

175
00:13:20,945 --> 00:13:22,779
- No need to apologize. - I told him I was sorry but he...

176
00:13:22,988 --> 00:13:24,364
I'm just indifferent right now

177
00:13:24,573 --> 00:13:27,034
You don't respect yourself, so I know you don't respect me

178
00:13:27,243 --> 00:13:28,660
- I respect you. - I'm just your babysitter

179
00:13:28,869 --> 00:13:30,870
and so, when you need your diaper changed, thank you...

180
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,206
let me know and I'll get you a bottle, okay?

181
00:13:33,415 --> 00:13:35,875
Hey, heat up the sake, will you? Thanks for reminding me

182
00:13:36,084 --> 00:13:38,586
I'm not talking... we're not drinking, we're working right now

183
00:13:38,795 --> 00:13:42,256
And you are constitutionally incapable of being responsible

184
00:13:42,506 --> 00:13:44,090
It would be irresponsible not to drink

185
00:13:44,258 --> 00:13:46,092
I'm just talking about the night cup. - Hot sake?

186
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,636
- Yes, two please. - No, just...

187
00:13:47,845 --> 00:13:49,846
I'm not drinking, I don't want any

188
00:13:50,055 --> 00:13:52,890
That's what I'm talking about. When I get up in the morning

189
00:13:53,099 --> 00:13:56,018
and I'm putting on my uniform, you know what I recognize?

190
00:13:56,269 --> 00:14:00,106
I see in that mirror that every person that's got this uniform

191
00:14:00,315 --> 00:14:03,609
will get my back! - Here we go again. I'm not like you

192
00:14:03,818 --> 00:14:07,237
No, you don't have to be like me. But you're more than... yes you are

193
00:14:07,363 --> 00:14:09,323
Will you excuse me, I'm a little bit distracted here

194
00:14:09,532 --> 00:14:12,743
No, you can't be distracted right now. Listen to me!

195
00:14:16,538 --> 00:14:19,582
BAGRAM AIR BASE, AFGHANISTAN

196
00:14:28,883 --> 00:14:29,967
General

197
00:14:30,176 --> 00:14:31,677
Welcome, Mr. Stark

198
00:14:32,178 --> 00:14:35,013
We look forward to your weapons presentation

199
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:39,267
Is it better to be feared or respected?

200
00:14:39,476 --> 00:14:42,895
And I say, is it too much to ask for both?

201
00:14:43,688 --> 00:14:46,482
With that in mind, I humbly present the crown jewel

202
00:14:46,691 --> 00:14:49,485
of Stark Industries freedom line. It's the first missile system

203
00:14:49,694 --> 00:14:52,613
to incorporate our proprietary repulsor technology

204
00:14:52,946 --> 00:14:56,574
They say the best weapon is one you never have to fire

205
00:14:56,867 --> 00:14:58,744
I respectfully disagree

206
00:14:58,953 --> 00:15:02,831
I prefer the weapon you only have to fire once

207
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,751
That's how dad did it, that's how America does it...

208
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,253
and it's worked out pretty well so far

209
00:15:09,462 --> 00:15:12,131
Find an excuse to let one of these off the chain

210
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:14,049
and I personally guarantee you

211
00:15:14,258 --> 00:15:17,469
the bad guys won't even want to come out of their caves

212
00:15:36,237 --> 00:15:39,990
For your consideration, the Jericho

213
00:15:51,501 --> 00:15:54,837
We throw one of these in with every purchase of 500 million or more

214
00:15:55,046 --> 00:15:56,547
To peace!

215
00:15:57,465 --> 00:15:59,342
- Tony. - Obie, what are you doing up?

216
00:15:59,551 --> 00:16:01,886
I couldn't sleep till I found out how it went. How did it go?

217
00:16:02,095 --> 00:16:04,305
Went great, looks like it's gonna be an early Christmas

218
00:16:04,513 --> 00:16:07,557
Hey, way to go, my boy. I'll see you tomorrow, yeah?

219
00:16:07,766 --> 00:16:09,726
Why aren't you wearing those pyjamas I got you?

220
00:16:09,852 --> 00:16:11,436
Good night, Tony

221
00:16:12,521 --> 00:16:13,688
Hey Tony!

222
00:16:13,897 --> 00:16:17,191
I'm sorry, this is the fun-vee. The hum-drum-vee is back there

223
00:16:17,525 --> 00:16:20,152
- Nice job. - See you back at base

224
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:29,091
I wouldn't do that if I were you

225
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:08,085
What the hell did you do to me?

226
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:10,421
What I did?

227
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:12,715
What I did is to save your life

228
00:18:12,924 --> 00:18:16,343
I removed all the shrapnel I could, but there's a lot left

229
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:19,053
and it's headed into your atrial septum

230
00:18:19,221 --> 00:18:21,055
Here, wanna see?

231
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:24,434
I have a souvenir. Take a look

232
00:18:27,228 --> 00:18:29,438
I've seen many wounds like that in my village

233
00:18:29,647 --> 00:18:31,648
We call them the walking dead

234
00:18:32,066 --> 00:18:35,069
Because in takes about a week for the balls to reach the vital organs

235
00:18:35,278 --> 00:18:38,238
- What is this? - That is an electromagnet

236
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:40,783
Hooked up to a car battery

237
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:44,453
And it's keeping the shrapnel from entering your heart

238
00:18:52,168 --> 00:18:54,461
That's right. Smile!

239
00:18:55,922 --> 00:18:57,506
We met once, you know

240
00:18:57,715 --> 00:18:59,967
At the technical conference in Bern

241
00:19:00,301 --> 00:19:03,011
- Don't remember. - No, you wouldn't

242
00:19:03,346 --> 00:19:06,557
If I had been that drunk, I wouldn't have been able to stand

243
00:19:06,766 --> 00:19:09,810
much less give a lecture on integrated circuits

244
00:19:10,019 --> 00:19:11,853
Where are we?

245
00:19:13,146 --> 00:19:15,356
Come on, stand up. Stand up

246
00:19:16,441 --> 00:19:18,109
Do as I do

247
00:19:18,401 --> 00:19:20,402
C'mon, put your hands up

248
00:19:22,488 --> 00:19:24,489
Those are my guns. How did they get my guns?

249
00:19:24,698 --> 00:19:26,699
Do you understand me? Do as I do

250
00:19:47,011 --> 00:19:49,263
He says: "Welcome Tony Stark

251
00:19:49,472 --> 00:19:53,100
the most famous mass murderer in the history of America. "

252
00:19:56,645 --> 00:19:58,188
He is honored

253
00:20:00,648 --> 00:20:03,025
He wants you to build a missile

254
00:20:03,734 --> 00:20:06,362
The Jericho missile that you demonstrated

255
00:20:09,782 --> 00:20:11,450
This one

256
00:20:15,996 --> 00:20:17,664
I refuse

257
00:20:27,673 --> 00:20:28,882
Tony!

258
00:21:18,763 --> 00:21:21,348
He wants to know what you think

259
00:21:22,016 --> 00:21:24,518
I think he got a lot of my weapons

260
00:21:32,817 --> 00:21:37,071
He says they have everything you need to build a Jericho missile

261
00:21:37,405 --> 00:21:40,157
He wants you to make the list of materials

262
00:21:43,327 --> 00:21:45,912
He says for you to start working immediately

263
00:21:46,122 --> 00:21:48,624
and when you're done, he will set you free

264
00:21:52,461 --> 00:21:53,962
No, I won't

265
00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:55,671
No, he won't

266
00:22:08,518 --> 00:22:11,061
I'm sure they're looking for you, Stark

267
00:22:11,353 --> 00:22:14,480
But they will never find you in these mountains

268
00:22:15,983 --> 00:22:17,359
Look...

269
00:22:18,652 --> 00:22:22,488
What you just saw... that is your legacy, Stark

270
00:22:24,115 --> 00:22:27,534
Your life's work in the hands of those murderers

271
00:22:27,743 --> 00:22:29,995
Is that how you want to go out?

272
00:22:30,537 --> 00:22:35,541
Is this the last act of defiance of the great Tony Stark?

273
00:22:36,251 --> 00:22:38,420
Or are you going to do something about it?

274
00:22:38,629 --> 00:22:41,631
Why should I do anything? They're gonna kill me, you...

275
00:22:42,341 --> 00:22:45,468
Either way, if they don't, I'll probably be dead in a week

276
00:22:46,761 --> 00:22:50,764
Well then... this is a very important week for you, isn't it?

277
00:22:53,642 --> 00:22:55,727
If this is gonna be my workstation

278
00:22:55,936 --> 00:22:58,021
I want it well lit, I want all of these tools

279
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:00,732
Welding gear, I don't care if it's acetylene or propane

280
00:23:00,899 --> 00:23:02,859
I need a soldering station, I need helmets

281
00:23:03,067 --> 00:23:04,985
I need goggles, I would like a smelting cup

282
00:23:05,153 --> 00:23:07,530
I need two sets of precision tools

283
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:21,668
How many languages do you speak?

284
00:23:21,877 --> 00:23:24,921
A lot. But apparently not enough for this place

285
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:28,549
They speak Arabic, Urdu, Dari, Pashto

286
00:23:28,883 --> 00:23:31,135
Mongolian, Farsi, Russian

287
00:23:31,552 --> 00:23:33,136
Who are these people?

288
00:23:33,345 --> 00:23:36,431
They are your loyal customers, sir

289
00:23:36,598 --> 00:23:39,434
They call themselves The Ten Rings

290
00:23:48,402 --> 00:23:50,445
You know, we might be more productive

291
00:23:50,654 --> 00:23:53,656
if you include me in the planning process? - Aha

292
00:24:01,246 --> 00:24:03,289
Okay. We don't need this

293
00:24:05,333 --> 00:24:06,834
What is that?

294
00:24:08,336 --> 00:24:11,965
That's palladium, 0.15 grams. We need at least 1.6

295
00:24:12,174 --> 00:24:15,176
so why don't you go break down the other eleven

296
00:24:17,178 --> 00:24:19,179
What are they doing?

297
00:24:19,972 --> 00:24:21,389
Working

298
00:24:31,399 --> 00:24:34,276
Careful. Careful, we only get one shot at this

299
00:24:34,611 --> 00:24:37,113
Relax, I've steady hands

300
00:24:37,947 --> 00:24:40,532
Why do you think you're still alive, huh?

301
00:24:46,747 --> 00:24:48,748
What do I call you?

302
00:24:49,041 --> 00:24:52,627
- My name is Yinsen. - Yinsen... nice to meet you

303
00:24:53,754 --> 00:24:55,755
Nice to meet you too

304
00:25:34,416 --> 00:25:38,085
Wow, that doesn't look like a Jericho missile

305
00:25:38,378 --> 00:25:41,172
That's because it is a miniaturized Arc reactor

306
00:25:41,923 --> 00:25:44,718
We got a big one powering my factory at home

307
00:25:44,926 --> 00:25:47,720
It should keep the shrapnel out of my heart

308
00:25:47,929 --> 00:25:49,722
But what could it generate?

309
00:25:49,931 --> 00:25:52,516
If my math is right, and it always is...

310
00:25:52,725 --> 00:25:54,643
three gigajoules per second

311
00:25:54,810 --> 00:25:58,479
That could run your heart for the 50 lifetimes. - Yeah

312
00:25:58,772 --> 00:26:01,065
Or something big for 50 minutes

313
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:12,325
This is our ticket outta here. - What is it?

314
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:16,705
'Flying the mountain' look

315
00:26:22,544 --> 00:26:24,045
Impressive

316
00:26:49,236 --> 00:26:51,029
Shesh Besh

317
00:26:52,239 --> 00:26:55,241
Good roll. Good roll

318
00:26:55,658 --> 00:26:57,659
You still didn't tell me where you're from

319
00:26:57,827 --> 00:27:00,370
I'm from a small town called Gulmira

320
00:27:00,579 --> 00:27:02,872
It's actually a nice place

321
00:27:03,082 --> 00:27:05,584
- You got a family? - Yes

322
00:27:06,001 --> 00:27:09,253
And I will see them when I leave here

323
00:27:09,462 --> 00:27:11,463
And you, Stark?

324
00:27:14,885 --> 00:27:15,927
Nothing

325
00:27:17,012 --> 00:27:18,054
No

326
00:27:19,222 --> 00:27:23,559
So you're a man who has everything... and nothing

327
00:28:09,435 --> 00:28:12,270
Doesn't look anything like the photo

328
00:28:12,479 --> 00:28:14,188
Maybe he modified it

329
00:28:14,356 --> 00:28:17,401
- The tail doesn't seem right. - Well, too bad

330
00:29:02,442 --> 00:29:03,985
Relax

331
00:29:12,743 --> 00:29:17,915
The bow and arrow once was the pinnacle of weapons technology

332
00:29:20,293 --> 00:29:23,087
It allowed the great Genghis Khan

333
00:29:23,379 --> 00:29:26,590
to rule from the Pacific to the Ukraine

334
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:30,593
An empire twice the size of Alexander the Great

335
00:29:32,137 --> 00:29:35,348
And four times the size of the Roman empire

336
00:29:39,268 --> 00:29:41,269
But today

337
00:29:41,478 --> 00:29:45,022
whoever holds the latest Stark weapons

338
00:29:45,982 --> 00:29:47,984
rules these lands

339
00:29:50,112 --> 00:29:52,155
And soon...

340
00:29:54,324 --> 00:29:56,409
...it will be my turn

341
00:30:09,254 --> 00:30:11,214
Why did you fail me?

342
00:30:11,715 --> 00:30:14,842
We're working on it. Diligently

343
00:30:15,259 --> 00:30:17,302
I spared your life

344
00:30:19,431 --> 00:30:21,474
Is this how you repay me?

345
00:30:22,058 --> 00:30:24,393
It's very complex

346
00:30:24,811 --> 00:30:26,937
We're trying hard

347
00:30:27,355 --> 00:30:29,148
On your knees

348
00:30:33,151 --> 00:30:35,111
You think I'm an idiot?

349
00:30:35,487 --> 00:30:37,113
Tell me the truth

350
00:30:37,489 --> 00:30:39,574
We are working hard

351
00:30:46,121 --> 00:30:47,872
Open your mouth

352
00:30:48,081 --> 00:30:51,084
- What does he want? - You think I'm a fool?

353
00:30:54,922 --> 00:30:56,715
What is going on?

354
00:30:57,007 --> 00:30:59,259
Tell me the truth

355
00:31:00,052 --> 00:31:01,809
We are working on Jericho

356
00:31:01,844 --> 00:31:02,621
Tell me the truth

357
00:31:02,667 --> 00:31:04,179
We are working on Jericho

358
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:06,390
What do you want, a delivery date?

359
00:31:13,772 --> 00:31:15,273
I need him

360
00:31:17,609 --> 00:31:19,611
He's a good assistant

361
00:31:23,907 --> 00:31:25,908
You have till tomorrow...

362
00:31:26,243 --> 00:31:28,244
...to assemble my missile

363
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:33,971
- Okay? - Yes

364
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:35,472
Can you move?

365
00:32:35,723 --> 00:32:37,224
Say it again

366
00:32:37,433 --> 00:32:39,267
41 steps straight ahead

367
00:32:39,435 --> 00:32:41,645
then 16 steps, left from the door, four to the right

368
00:32:41,854 --> 00:32:43,647
33 steps, turn right

369
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:52,614
Where is Stark?

370
00:32:52,823 --> 00:32:54,741
He was here a moment ago

371
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:56,326
Go find him!

372
00:33:11,381 --> 00:33:12,548
Yinsen!

373
00:33:12,758 --> 00:33:14,134
Yinsen! Stark!

374
00:33:14,342 --> 00:33:15,801
Say something

375
00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:17,928
He is speaking Hungarian, I don't...

376
00:33:18,137 --> 00:33:19,930
- Speak Hungarian. - Okay...

377
00:33:20,139 --> 00:33:21,807
What do you know?

378
00:33:44,787 --> 00:33:47,080
- How did that work? - Oh my goodness

379
00:33:47,289 --> 00:33:49,123
- It worked all right. - What do I do?

380
00:33:49,291 --> 00:33:52,043
- Let me finish this. - Finish last powering sequence

381
00:33:52,252 --> 00:33:53,379
Okay

382
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,756
Now! Tell me, tell me!

383
00:33:55,965 --> 00:33:58,634
F 11. Tell me when you see a progress bar

384
00:33:58,801 --> 00:34:00,552
It should be up right now

385
00:34:00,761 --> 00:34:02,762
Talk to me, tell me when you see it. - I have it

386
00:34:02,971 --> 00:34:04,263
- Press Ctrl + I. - Got it

387
00:34:04,472 --> 00:34:07,516
'Enter'. I, 'Enter'. Come over here and button me up

388
00:34:11,937 --> 00:34:14,022
They are coming!

389
00:34:14,231 --> 00:34:16,274
Doesn't need to look pretty, just get it done

390
00:34:16,483 --> 00:34:17,942
They are coming

391
00:34:19,361 --> 00:34:22,113
Make sure that checkpoints are clear before you follow me out, OK?

392
00:34:22,322 --> 00:34:23,782
We need more time

393
00:34:24,783 --> 00:34:25,909
Okay

394
00:34:26,618 --> 00:34:28,244
I'm gonna go buy you some time

395
00:34:28,412 --> 00:34:29,829
Stick to the plan!

396
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:32,539
Stick to the plan!

397
00:34:33,958 --> 00:34:35,417
Yinsen!

398
00:37:27,828 --> 00:37:29,871
- Yinsen! - Watch out!

399
00:37:45,302 --> 00:37:46,469
Stark

400
00:37:47,762 --> 00:37:49,805
Come on. We gotta go

401
00:37:50,515 --> 00:37:53,726
Move with me. C'mon, we got a plan, we need to stick to it

402
00:37:53,935 --> 00:37:55,728
This was always the plan, Stark

403
00:37:55,936 --> 00:37:58,939
Come on, you're going to go see your family again

404
00:37:59,607 --> 00:38:02,359
My family is dead

405
00:38:02,527 --> 00:38:04,945
I'm going to see them now, Stark

406
00:38:07,114 --> 00:38:09,449
It's okay. It's okay

407
00:38:10,534 --> 00:38:13,578
I want this. I want this

408
00:38:19,625 --> 00:38:21,626
Thank you for saving me

409
00:38:22,962 --> 00:38:26,256
Don't waste it. Don't waste your life

410
00:39:06,044 --> 00:39:07,295
My turn

411
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,141
Not bad

412
00:41:47,652 --> 00:41:49,445
How was the fun-vee?

413
00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:54,782
Next time you ride with me, okay?

414
00:42:25,603 --> 00:42:27,604
Watch it coming up here

415
00:42:29,148 --> 00:42:32,150
Are you kidding me with this? Get rid of them

416
00:42:40,242 --> 00:42:41,743
Your eyes are red

417
00:42:41,952 --> 00:42:43,745
Few tears for your long lost boss?

418
00:42:43,954 --> 00:42:46,789
Tears of joy. I hate job hunting

419
00:42:46,998 --> 00:42:48,832
Yeah, vacation's over

420
00:42:50,043 --> 00:42:51,252
Where to, sir?

421
00:42:51,461 --> 00:42:54,046
Take us to the hospital, please. - No. - No? Tony...

422
00:42:54,255 --> 00:42:56,882
- You have to go to the hospital. - I don't have to do anything

423
00:42:57,091 --> 00:42:59,718
I was in captivity for three months. There are two things I want to do

424
00:42:59,927 --> 00:43:02,137
I want an American cheeseburger...

425
00:43:02,596 --> 00:43:04,222
...and the other one... - That's not going to happen

426
00:43:04,431 --> 00:43:06,684
It's not what you think. I want you to call for a press conference now

427
00:43:06,892 --> 00:43:08,935
Call for a press conference? What on earth for?

428
00:43:09,144 --> 00:43:11,145
Yeah, Hogan, drive. Cheeseburger first

429
00:43:22,906 --> 00:43:24,740
Look at this!

430
00:43:26,410 --> 00:43:27,661
Tony!

431
00:43:29,954 --> 00:43:32,122
I thought you'll be in a hospital

432
00:43:32,957 --> 00:43:34,416
Look at you!

433
00:43:34,875 --> 00:43:36,919
Oh, burger, you had to have a burger

434
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:38,630
Did you get me one of those?

435
00:43:38,838 --> 00:43:40,839
There was only one left, I needed it

436
00:43:42,967 --> 00:43:44,968
Hey, look who's here!

437
00:43:51,016 --> 00:43:52,559
- Ms. Potts? - Yes

438
00:43:52,767 --> 00:43:54,268
May I speak with you for a moment?

439
00:43:54,477 --> 00:43:57,354
I'm not part of the press conference, but it's about to begin right now

440
00:43:57,563 --> 00:43:59,815
I am not a reporter. I'm agent Phil Coulson

441
00:44:00,024 --> 00:44:01,984
with the Strategic Homeland Intervention

442
00:44:02,193 --> 00:44:03,986
Enforcement and Logistics Division

443
00:44:04,194 --> 00:44:06,989
- That's quite a mouthful. - I know. We're working on it

444
00:44:07,198 --> 00:44:11,201
We've been approached already by the DOD, FBI, CIA...

445
00:44:11,410 --> 00:44:14,954
We are a separate division. With a more specific focus

446
00:44:15,163 --> 00:44:18,374
We need to debrief Mr. Stark about the circumstances of his escape

447
00:44:18,708 --> 00:44:21,502
- I'll put something in a book, shell I? - Thank you

448
00:44:27,049 --> 00:44:29,759
Hey, would it be alright if everyone sat down?

449
00:44:29,968 --> 00:44:32,970
Will you sit down? That way you can see me, and I can...

450
00:44:33,263 --> 00:44:35,306
A little less formal...

451
00:44:40,229 --> 00:44:41,855
What's up with the lovin'?

452
00:44:42,064 --> 00:44:44,566
Don't look at me, I don't know what he's up to

453
00:44:45,025 --> 00:44:47,402
- Good to see you. - Good to see you

454
00:44:47,610 --> 00:44:50,112
I never got to say goodbye to dad

455
00:44:50,321 --> 00:44:53,073
I never got to say goodbye to my father

456
00:44:56,702 --> 00:44:58,745
There's questions that I would've asked him

457
00:44:58,954 --> 00:45:02,206
I would've asked him how he felt about what his company did...

458
00:45:02,624 --> 00:45:05,584
...if he was conflicted, if he ever had doubts

459
00:45:06,585 --> 00:45:10,381
Or maybe he was every inch of a man we all remember from the newsreels

460
00:45:15,052 --> 00:45:17,887
I saw young Americans killed...

461
00:45:18,264 --> 00:45:22,601
...by the very weapons I created to defend them and protect them

462
00:45:23,602 --> 00:45:27,063
And I saw that I had become part of a system

463
00:45:27,313 --> 00:45:30,607
that is comfortable with zero-accountability

464
00:45:33,777 --> 00:45:35,611
What happened over there?

465
00:45:36,155 --> 00:45:37,948
I had my eyes opened

466
00:45:38,115 --> 00:45:41,410
I came to realize that I have more to offer

467
00:45:41,619 --> 00:45:44,663
this world than just making things that blow up

468
00:45:44,830 --> 00:45:48,124
And that is why, effective immediately, I'm shutting down

469
00:45:48,333 --> 00:45:51,669
the weapons manufacturing division of Stark International...

470
00:45:52,170 --> 00:45:54,588
...untill such a time, as I can decide

471
00:45:54,797 --> 00:45:56,798
what the future of this company will be

472
00:45:57,008 --> 00:45:59,677
what direction it should take, the one I'm comfortable with

473
00:45:59,885 --> 00:46:03,721
and is consistent with the highest good of this country and the world

474
00:46:05,056 --> 00:46:07,891
What we should take away from this...

475
00:46:08,059 --> 00:46:10,061
...is that Tony's back!

476
00:46:10,479 --> 00:46:12,897
And he's healthier than ever

477
00:46:13,231 --> 00:46:16,400
We are gonna have a little internal discussion

478
00:46:16,609 --> 00:46:19,444
and we'll get back to you with a follow-up

479
00:46:21,072 --> 00:46:23,324
- Where is he? - He's inside

480
00:46:34,417 --> 00:46:36,794
That... that went well

481
00:46:37,003 --> 00:46:39,505
Did I just paint a target on the back of my head?

482
00:46:39,713 --> 00:46:41,674
Your head? What about my head?

483
00:46:41,883 --> 00:46:45,135
What do you think the over-under on a stock drop is gonna be?

484
00:46:45,344 --> 00:46:48,346
- Optimistically? 40 Points? - At minimum

485
00:46:50,015 --> 00:46:52,850
Tony, we're a weapons manufacturer

486
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:55,729
Obie, I just... I don't want the body count to be up...

487
00:46:55,937 --> 00:46:58,689
That's what we do. We're iron mongers, we make weapons

488
00:46:58,857 --> 00:47:00,691
My name is on facade of the building

489
00:47:00,858 --> 00:47:02,984
What we do keeps the world from falling into chaos

490
00:47:03,194 --> 00:47:04,862
Not based on what I saw

491
00:47:05,404 --> 00:47:06,863
We're not doing a good enough job

492
00:47:07,072 --> 00:47:08,656
We can do better, we're gonna do something else

493
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:11,618
Oh, like what? You want us to make baby bottles?

494
00:47:12,370 --> 00:47:15,748
I think we should take another look into Arc Reactor technology

495
00:47:15,956 --> 00:47:19,542
Oh, come on. The Arc Reactor, that's a publicity stunt!

496
00:47:19,751 --> 00:47:23,129
Tony, c'mon! We built that thing to shut the hippies up!

497
00:47:23,338 --> 00:47:26,549
- It works. - Yeah, as a science project

498
00:47:27,049 --> 00:47:30,510
The Arc was never cost-effective. We knew that before we built it

499
00:47:30,719 --> 00:47:33,471
Arc Reactor technology, that's a dead end, right?

500
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:35,605
- Maybe. - Am I right?

501
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:38,684
We haven't had a breakthrough in that, in what... 30 years

502
00:47:38,893 --> 00:47:40,853
That's what they say

503
00:47:42,856 --> 00:47:44,649
Could you have a lousier poker face?

504
00:47:44,858 --> 00:47:47,068
Just tell me, who told you? - Never mind who told me

505
00:47:47,277 --> 00:47:48,820
- Show me. - Rhodey or Pepper

506
00:47:48,987 --> 00:47:50,988
- I wanna see it. - Okay, Rhodey

507
00:48:04,167 --> 00:48:05,668
It works

508
00:48:09,463 --> 00:48:11,506
Listen to me, Tony

509
00:48:11,882 --> 00:48:13,759
We are a team, do you understand?

510
00:48:13,968 --> 00:48:16,470
There's nothing we can't do if we stick together

511
00:48:16,679 --> 00:48:18,305
like your father and I

512
00:48:18,514 --> 00:48:21,349
I'm sorry I didn't give you a heads up, okay? But if I had...

513
00:48:21,558 --> 00:48:25,144
Tony, no more of this 'ready - fire - aim' business

514
00:48:25,354 --> 00:48:27,981
- Do you understand me? - That was dad's line

515
00:48:28,606 --> 00:48:30,524
You gotta let me handle this

516
00:48:30,733 --> 00:48:33,110
We're gonna have to play whole different kind of ball now

517
00:48:33,319 --> 00:48:35,112
We're gonna have to take a lot of heat

518
00:48:35,321 --> 00:48:38,407
I want you to promise me that you're gonna lay low

519
00:48:38,699 --> 00:48:43,162
<i>Stark Industries. I've got one recommendation. Ready, ready?</i>

520
00:48:43,829 --> 00:48:45,163
<i>Sell, sell, sell!</i>

521
00:48:45,372 --> 00:48:47,165
<i>Abandon ship!</i>

522
00:48:47,499 --> 00:48:50,418
<i>Does the 'Hindenburg' ring any bells?</i>

523
00:48:51,795 --> 00:48:56,007
<i>Let me show you the new Stark Industries business plan!</i>

524
00:48:58,259 --> 00:49:02,095
<i>Look, that's a weapons company that doesn't make weapons!</i>

525
00:49:02,805 --> 00:49:05,640
Pepper! How big are your hands?

526
00:49:05,849 --> 00:49:08,351
- What? - How big are your hands?

527
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:11,395
- I don't understand why... - Get down here. I need you

528
00:49:18,611 --> 00:49:19,737
Hey!

529
00:49:21,614 --> 00:49:23,699
Let's see them. Show me your hands

530
00:49:23,950 --> 00:49:25,409
Let's see them

531
00:49:25,743 --> 00:49:28,537
Oh, wow, they are small. Very petite, indeed

532
00:49:28,746 --> 00:49:31,164
I just need your help for a sec

533
00:49:31,957 --> 00:49:34,459
Oh my God, is that the thing that's keeping you alive?

534
00:49:34,667 --> 00:49:36,877
It was, it is now an antique

535
00:49:37,462 --> 00:49:40,422
This is what will be keeping me alive for the foreseeable future

536
00:49:40,631 --> 00:49:42,632
I was swapping it up for an upgraded unit

537
00:49:42,841 --> 00:49:45,177
and I just ran into a little... speed bump

538
00:49:45,345 --> 00:49:46,888
Speed bump? What's happening?

539
00:49:47,096 --> 00:49:48,680
It's nothing, it's just a little snag

540
00:49:48,848 --> 00:49:51,266
There's an exposed wire under this device

541
00:49:51,475 --> 00:49:53,143
and is contacting a socket wall

542
00:49:53,352 --> 00:49:55,353
and is causing a little bit of a short circuit

543
00:49:57,314 --> 00:49:58,606
What do you want me to do?

544
00:49:58,815 --> 00:50:01,275
Put that on the table over there. That is irrelevant

545
00:50:01,484 --> 00:50:02,943
I just want you to reach in...

546
00:50:03,152 --> 00:50:05,654
and you're just gonna gently lift the wire out

547
00:50:06,405 --> 00:50:07,697
Is it safe?

548
00:50:07,907 --> 00:50:09,741
Yeah, it should be fine. It's just like an operation

549
00:50:09,908 --> 00:50:11,409
you just don't let it touch the socket wall

550
00:50:11,618 --> 00:50:14,328
- What's Operation? - It's just a game, never mind

551
00:50:14,537 --> 00:50:18,166
- Just gently lift the wire. - Okay. - Okay? Great

552
00:50:20,252 --> 00:50:22,795
You know, I don't think that I am qualified to do this

553
00:50:23,004 --> 00:50:25,547
No, no, you're fine. You're the most capable

554
00:50:25,757 --> 00:50:28,843
qualified and trustworthy person I've ever met

555
00:50:29,051 --> 00:50:30,844
You're gonna do great

556
00:50:31,637 --> 00:50:35,306
Is it too much of a problem to ask? Cause I really need your help here

557
00:50:42,188 --> 00:50:44,148
- Oh, there's pus! - It's not pus

558
00:50:44,357 --> 00:50:49,112
It's a plasmic discharge, it's from the device, not from my body

559
00:50:49,404 --> 00:50:51,489
- It smells! - Yeah, it does

560
00:50:52,156 --> 00:50:53,782
The copper wire

561
00:50:53,991 --> 00:50:56,243
The copper wire, you got it? - I got it

562
00:50:56,452 --> 00:50:57,869
Now don't let it touch...

563
00:50:58,329 --> 00:51:01,331
...the sides, that's what I was trying to tell you before

564
00:51:01,665 --> 00:51:03,541
Okay, now make sure that when you pull it out

565
00:51:03,708 --> 00:51:06,043
you don't pull out the magnet and the end of it. That was it...

566
00:51:06,252 --> 00:51:09,254
...that you just pulled out. - Oh God. OK, what do I do?

567
00:51:09,505 --> 00:51:11,548
- Don't put it back in! - What's wrong?

568
00:51:11,716 --> 00:51:13,842
Nothing, I'm just going into cardiac arrest cause you yanked out...

569
00:51:14,051 --> 00:51:17,263
- What? I thought you said this was safe! - We gotta hurry

570
00:51:17,298 --> 00:51:19,723
Take this, you gotta switch, real quick. - Okay, okay

571
00:51:20,099 --> 00:51:24,311
Tony, it's gonna be okay. I'm gonna make this okay

572
00:51:25,604 --> 00:51:28,147
You gotta touch that to base plate

573
00:51:28,356 --> 00:51:30,149
And make sure you...

574
00:51:33,945 --> 00:51:35,321
Was that so hard?

575
00:51:35,530 --> 00:51:37,948
That was fun, right? I got it, I got it

576
00:51:38,616 --> 00:51:39,616
Nice

577
00:51:39,825 --> 00:51:41,951
- Are you okay? - Yeah, I feel great

578
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:43,786
Are you okay?

579
00:51:44,913 --> 00:51:47,332
Don't ever, ever...

580
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:50,502
...ever ask me to do anything like that ever again

581
00:51:50,919 --> 00:51:53,337
I don't have anyone but you

582
00:51:58,551 --> 00:51:59,968
Are we ready?

583
00:52:05,391 --> 00:52:07,559
What do you want me to do with this?

584
00:52:07,976 --> 00:52:11,645
That? Destroy it. Incinerate it

585
00:52:13,064 --> 00:52:14,898
You don't wanna keep it?

586
00:52:15,066 --> 00:52:16,900
Pepper, I've been called many things

587
00:52:17,109 --> 00:52:18,903
Nostalgic is not one of them

588
00:52:19,446 --> 00:52:23,074
- Would that be all, Mr. Stark? - That would be all, Ms. Potts

589
00:52:23,783 --> 00:52:25,617
Hey butterfingers, come here

590
00:52:25,785 --> 00:52:27,995
What's all this stuff doing on top of my desk?

591
00:52:28,204 --> 00:52:30,706
That's my phone, that's a picture of me and my dad...

592
00:52:30,914 --> 00:52:33,916
Right there. In garbage. All that stuff

593
00:52:40,173 --> 00:52:42,216
The future of air combat

594
00:52:42,550 --> 00:52:44,676
Is it manned or unmanned?

595
00:52:44,969 --> 00:52:48,848
I tell you, in my experience, no unmanned aerial vehicle

596
00:52:49,015 --> 00:52:51,850
will ever trump a pilot's instinct

597
00:52:52,226 --> 00:52:55,270
his insight - that ability to look into a situation

598
00:52:55,479 --> 00:52:58,398
beyond the obvious and discern its outcome

599
00:52:58,607 --> 00:53:00,191
Or pilot's judgement

600
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:03,027
Colonel, it's... why not a pilot without a plane?

601
00:53:03,236 --> 00:53:05,613
Look who fell outta the sky! Mr. Tony Stark

602
00:53:05,822 --> 00:53:07,323
Speaking about manned or unmanned

603
00:53:07,531 --> 00:53:09,115
you gotta get him to tell you about the time he guessed wrong

604
00:53:09,325 --> 00:53:10,784
It's spring break, just remember that

605
00:53:10,993 --> 00:53:14,412
Spring break 1987, that lovely lady, what was his name?

606
00:53:14,621 --> 00:53:15,830
Was it Ivan?

607
00:53:16,039 --> 00:53:18,416
Don't do that, they'll believe it. Don't do that

608
00:53:18,625 --> 00:53:21,295
Give us a couple of minutes, you guys

609
00:53:24,631 --> 00:53:26,090
- I'm surprised. - Why?

610
00:53:26,299 --> 00:53:28,842
I swear I didn't expect to see you walking around so soon

611
00:53:29,052 --> 00:53:31,012
I'm doing a little better than walking

612
00:53:31,220 --> 00:53:32,637
- Really? - Yeah

613
00:53:33,306 --> 00:53:35,683
Rhodey, I'm working on something big

614
00:53:35,933 --> 00:53:39,144
I came to talk to you. I want you to be part of it

615
00:53:39,853 --> 00:53:43,481
You're about to make a whole lotta people around here real happy

616
00:53:43,648 --> 00:53:47,317
cause that little stunt at the press conference, that was juicy

617
00:53:47,944 --> 00:53:52,157
This is not for the military. I'm not... it's different

618
00:53:52,365 --> 00:53:55,159
What, are you humanitarian now or something?

619
00:53:55,368 --> 00:53:57,077
I need you to listen to me

620
00:53:57,286 --> 00:54:00,705
No, what you need is time to get your mind right

621
00:54:02,332 --> 00:54:04,083
I'm serious

622
00:54:06,795 --> 00:54:08,755
It was nice seeing you, Tony

623
00:54:08,963 --> 00:54:10,631
Thanks

624
00:54:18,639 --> 00:54:21,767
- Jarvis, are you up? - For you sir, always

625
00:54:22,101 --> 00:54:25,770
I'd like to open a new project file, index as: Mark 2

626
00:54:27,106 --> 00:54:30,484
Shell I store this on the Stark Industries' central database?

627
00:54:31,151 --> 00:54:33,820
I don't know who to trust right now. Till further notice

628
00:54:33,987 --> 00:54:36,656
why don't we just keep everything on my private server

629
00:54:36,864 --> 00:54:39,533
Working on a secret project, are we, sir?

630
00:54:43,245 --> 00:54:45,872
I don't want this winding up in the wrong hands

631
00:54:48,375 --> 00:54:51,170
Maybe in mine it could actually do some good

632
00:55:34,001 --> 00:55:35,293
Next

633
00:55:36,294 --> 00:55:37,503
Up

634
00:55:37,712 --> 00:55:40,464
Not the boot, Dummy, right here. You got me?

635
00:55:40,673 --> 00:55:42,549
Stay put. Nice

636
00:55:44,051 --> 00:55:46,928
And you, you're no better at it at all. Lift... I got it

637
00:55:48,681 --> 00:55:50,807
Okay, I'm sorry, am I in your way?

638
00:55:57,606 --> 00:55:58,606
Up

639
00:55:59,608 --> 00:56:02,235
That's great, don't even move

640
00:56:02,611 --> 00:56:05,154
You... are a tragedy

641
00:56:14,663 --> 00:56:16,873
Okay, lets do this right

642
00:56:17,541 --> 00:56:20,668
Start mark, half meter back of the center

643
00:56:23,297 --> 00:56:25,632
Dummy, look for light. Stand back for fire safety

644
00:56:25,799 --> 00:56:27,633
You, roll it

645
00:56:31,971 --> 00:56:33,972
Activate hand controls

646
00:56:37,351 --> 00:56:39,144
We are gonna start up nice and easy

647
00:56:39,353 --> 00:56:41,563
raising 10% thrust capacity to achieve lift

648
00:56:42,064 --> 00:56:46,067
And 3, 2, 1

649
00:57:24,353 --> 00:57:26,605
Up two? Alright, step back

650
00:57:26,814 --> 00:57:28,940
I've been buzzing you. Did you hear the intercom?

651
00:57:29,108 --> 00:57:30,734
Yeah, everything's... what?

652
00:57:30,943 --> 00:57:33,903
- Obadiah's upstairs. - Great, I'll be right up

653
00:57:36,489 --> 00:57:38,657
I thought you said you were done making weapons?

654
00:57:38,866 --> 00:57:41,701
It isn't. This is a flight stabilizer

655
00:57:41,911 --> 00:57:43,787
It's completely harmless

656
00:57:47,749 --> 00:57:49,583
I didn't expect that

657
00:57:54,213 --> 00:57:55,840
How'd it go?

658
00:57:57,884 --> 00:57:59,844
Oh, went that bad huh?

659
00:58:00,053 --> 00:58:02,638
Just because I brought pizza back from New York

660
00:58:02,847 --> 00:58:06,058
doesn't mean it went bad. - Sure doesn't. Oh, boy

661
00:58:06,392 --> 00:58:08,602
It would've gone better if you were there

662
00:58:09,562 --> 00:58:11,939
You told me to lay low and that's what I've been doing

663
00:58:12,147 --> 00:58:13,773
I lay low and you take care of all the...

664
00:58:13,982 --> 00:58:15,983
Hey, c'mon. In public, the press...

665
00:58:16,526 --> 00:58:18,778
This was a Board of Directors meeting

666
00:58:18,987 --> 00:58:21,447
This was a Board of Directors meeting?

667
00:58:22,365 --> 00:58:24,283
The Board is claiming a Post Traumatic Stress

668
00:58:24,492 --> 00:58:26,578
They are filing an injunction. - A what?

669
00:58:26,786 --> 00:58:28,162
They wanna lock you out

670
00:58:28,371 --> 00:58:30,414
Why, cause the stocks dip 40 points? We knew this was gonna happen

671
00:58:30,623 --> 00:58:32,624
- 56 and a half. - It doesn't matter

672
00:58:32,792 --> 00:58:34,918
We own a controlling interest in the company

673
00:58:35,127 --> 00:58:37,670
Tony, the Board has rights too

674
00:58:38,213 --> 00:58:41,799
They are making the case that you and your new direction

675
00:58:42,008 --> 00:58:43,842
isn't in a company's best interest

676
00:58:44,052 --> 00:58:46,137
I'm being responsible. That's a new direction

677
00:58:46,345 --> 00:58:48,179
For me... for the company

678
00:58:48,347 --> 00:58:52,183
I mean, me on the company's behalf being responsible for the way that...

679
00:58:52,518 --> 00:58:55,812
- Oh, this is great! - Oh c'mon, wait! Tony, Tony!

680
00:58:56,104 --> 00:58:59,107
- I'll be in the shop. - Hey, hey, Tony, listen

681
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:01,401
I'm trying to turn this thing around

682
00:59:01,610 --> 00:59:04,570
but you gotta give me something. Something to pitch them

683
00:59:04,738 --> 00:59:07,323
Let me have the engineers analyze that, you know

684
00:59:07,532 --> 00:59:09,325
draw some specs. - No

685
00:59:09,534 --> 00:59:11,577
No. Absolutely not. This one stays with me

686
00:59:11,744 --> 00:59:13,495
That's it Obie. Forget it

687
00:59:13,704 --> 00:59:15,121
Alright, well this stays with me then

688
00:59:15,331 --> 00:59:18,125
Go on, here, you can have a piece. Take two. - Thank you

689
00:59:18,333 --> 00:59:20,751
Do you mind if I come down there to see what you're doing?

690
00:59:20,961 --> 00:59:22,337
Good night, Obie

691
00:59:22,671 --> 00:59:25,798
Day 11, Test 37, Configuration 2.0

692
00:59:26,007 --> 00:59:28,843
For lack of a better option, Dummy is still on fire safety

693
00:59:29,052 --> 00:59:31,679
If you douse me again, and I'm not on fire

694
00:59:31,888 --> 00:59:34,807
I'm donating you to a city college. Alright, nice and easy

695
00:59:35,099 --> 00:59:39,728
Seriously, just gonna start off with 1% thrust capacity

696
00:59:41,522 --> 00:59:43,315
And 3, 2, 1

697
00:59:58,038 --> 01:00:00,081
Please don't follow me around with it either cause I feel

698
01:00:00,290 --> 01:00:02,708
like I'm going to catch on fire spontaneously. Just stand down

699
01:00:02,875 --> 01:00:04,584
If something happens, then come in

700
01:00:04,752 --> 01:00:07,963
Again, lets bring it up to 2.5%. 3, 2, 1...

701
01:00:24,061 --> 01:00:26,396
Okay, this is where I don't want to be

702
01:00:27,147 --> 01:00:29,024
Not the car, not the car

703
01:00:41,828 --> 01:00:43,829
It could be worse. We are fine

704
01:00:45,873 --> 01:00:47,999
Okay, we are getting there

705
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:09,561
Yeah. I can fly

706
01:01:13,941 --> 01:01:16,359
- Jarvis, are you there? - At your service, sir

707
01:01:16,777 --> 01:01:19,154
Engage head up display. Check

708
01:01:19,362 --> 01:01:21,780
Import all preferences from home interface

709
01:01:21,948 --> 01:01:23,365
Will do, sir

710
01:01:29,413 --> 01:01:31,374
Alright, what do you say?

711
01:01:31,583 --> 01:01:34,168
I have indeed been uploaded, sir. We're online and ready

712
01:01:34,377 --> 01:01:36,211
Start the virtual walkaround

713
01:01:36,420 --> 01:01:39,214
Importing preferences and calibrating virtual environment

714
01:01:39,423 --> 01:01:42,300
- Do a check on control surfaces. - As you wish

715
01:02:04,029 --> 01:02:07,240
Test complete. Preparing to power down and begin diagnostics

716
01:02:07,407 --> 01:02:09,867
Ah, yes... tell you what. Do a weather and ATC check

717
01:02:10,076 --> 01:02:11,577
Start listening the ground control

718
01:02:11,744 --> 01:02:14,287
Sir, there are still terabytes of calculations needed

719
01:02:14,497 --> 01:02:16,457
before an actual flight. - Jarvis...

720
01:02:16,665 --> 01:02:19,292
Sometimes you gotta run before you can walk

721
01:02:19,460 --> 01:02:23,296
Ready? And 3, 2, 1

722
01:02:46,777 --> 01:02:48,820
It feels like a dream

723
01:03:16,752 --> 01:03:18,708
Alright, lets see what this thing can do

724
01:03:18,884 --> 01:03:20,536
What's the SR-71's record?

725
01:03:20,753 --> 01:03:24,188
The altitude record for fixed-wing flight is 85.000 feet, sir

726
01:03:24,405 --> 01:03:26,840
Records are made to be broken. C'mon!

727
01:03:30,493 --> 01:03:33,973
Sir, there is a potentially fatal build-up of ice occurring

728
01:03:34,146 --> 01:03:35,581
Keep going!

729
01:03:37,016 --> 01:03:38,538
Higher!

730
01:03:52,756 --> 01:03:55,234
We're iced up, Jarvis! Deploy flaps

731
01:03:55,974 --> 01:03:57,452
Jarvis?

732
01:03:59,453 --> 01:04:01,670
C'mon, we gotta break the ice!

733
01:04:37,110 --> 01:04:38,544
Cut power

734
01:06:02,727 --> 01:06:06,163
Note: main transducer feels sluggish at plus 40 altitude

735
01:06:06,336 --> 01:06:08,336
The whole pressurization is problematic

736
01:06:08,554 --> 01:06:10,771
I'm thinking 'icy' is a probable factor

737
01:06:10,945 --> 01:06:13,858
A very astute observation, sir. Perhaps if you intend to visit

738
01:06:14,033 --> 01:06:16,206
other planets, we should improve the exo systems

739
01:06:16,424 --> 01:06:18,946
Connect to the Cisco, have it reconfigure the shell metals

740
01:06:19,163 --> 01:06:21,989
Use the gold-titanium alloy from the Seraphim tactical satellite

741
01:06:22,208 --> 01:06:24,381
That should ensure the fuselage integrity

742
01:06:24,599 --> 01:06:26,815
while maintaining power -to-weight ratio. Got it?

743
01:06:26,990 --> 01:06:29,816
Yes. Shall I render using proposed specifications?

744
01:06:30,034 --> 01:06:31,512
Thrill me

745
01:06:32,687 --> 01:06:34,651
<i>Tonight's red hot, red carpeted,</i>

746
01:06:34,686 --> 01:06:36,860
<i>right here at the Disney Concert Hall,</i>

747
01:06:37,079 --> 01:06:39,861
<i>where Tony Stark's third annual benefit for</i>

748
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:43,079
<i>the Firefighters Family Fund has become the place to be...</i>

749
01:06:43,340 --> 01:06:45,080
Jarvis, did we get an invite from them?

750
01:06:45,253 --> 01:06:47,644
I have no record of the invitation, sir

751
01:06:48,080 --> 01:06:49,949
<i>...haven't been seen in public</i>

752
01:06:50,123 --> 01:06:53,079
<i>since his bizarre and highly controversial press conference.</i>

753
01:06:53,298 --> 01:06:55,906
<i>Some claim he's suffering from PTS and has been</i>

754
01:06:56,124 --> 01:06:58,819
<i>bed ridden for weeks. Whatever the case may be,</i>

755
01:06:58,994 --> 01:07:01,994
<i>no one expects an appearance from him tonight.</i>

756
01:07:02,429 --> 01:07:03,863
The render is complete

757
01:07:04,385 --> 01:07:06,429
Little ostentatious, don't you think?

758
01:07:06,646 --> 01:07:09,690
What was I thinking? You're usually so discrete

759
01:07:10,996 --> 01:07:13,909
Tell you what... throw a little hot rot red in there

760
01:07:14,083 --> 01:07:16,517
Yes, that shall help you keep a low profile

761
01:07:19,953 --> 01:07:21,952
The render is complete

762
01:07:22,301 --> 01:07:24,300
Yeah, I like it. Fabricate it and paint it

763
01:07:24,475 --> 01:07:26,127
Commencing an automated assembly

764
01:07:26,344 --> 01:07:28,561
Estimated completion time is five hours

765
01:07:29,128 --> 01:07:31,171
Don't wait up for me, honey

766
01:07:54,435 --> 01:07:56,217
The weapons manufacturing is...

767
01:07:56,434 --> 01:07:59,825
only a one small part of what Stark Industries is all about...

768
01:08:04,914 --> 01:08:07,783
- Hey Tony, remember me? - I sure don't

769
01:08:08,784 --> 01:08:10,610
You look great, Hef

770
01:08:13,437 --> 01:08:17,002
What's the world coming to when a guy's gotta crash his own party?

771
01:08:17,524 --> 01:08:19,132
Look at you!

772
01:08:20,307 --> 01:08:23,003
- Hey, what a surprise! - I'll see you inside

773
01:08:25,046 --> 01:08:27,045
Listen, take it slow, alright?

774
01:08:27,220 --> 01:08:29,351
I got the Board where I really want them

775
01:08:29,568 --> 01:08:32,264
You got it. Just cabin fever, I'll just be a minute

776
01:08:37,004 --> 01:08:39,134
Give me a Scotch, I'm starving

777
01:08:40,136 --> 01:08:42,135
- Mr. Stark? - Yeah?

778
01:08:42,396 --> 01:08:45,396
- Agent Coulson. - Oh yeah, the guy from the...

779
01:08:45,658 --> 01:08:47,354
Strategic Homeland Intervention

780
01:08:47,527 --> 01:08:49,527
Enforcement and Logistics Division

781
01:08:49,658 --> 01:08:51,571
God, you got... you need a new name for that

782
01:08:51,745 --> 01:08:53,353
Yeah, I hear that a lot

783
01:08:53,789 --> 01:08:56,006
Listen, I know this must be a trying time for you

784
01:08:56,223 --> 01:08:57,788
but we need to debrief you

785
01:08:58,006 --> 01:09:00,006
There's still a lot of unanswered questions

786
01:09:00,224 --> 01:09:02,006
and time can be a factor with these things

787
01:09:02,224 --> 01:09:04,006
Lets just put something on the books

788
01:09:04,224 --> 01:09:07,224
How about the 24th, at 7 p. m. at Stark Industries?

789
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:10,964
Tell you what... you got it. You're absolutely right

790
01:09:11,269 --> 01:09:15,487
Well... I'm gonna go to my assistant and we'll make it date

791
01:09:17,096 --> 01:09:19,095
You look fantastic, I didn't recognise you

792
01:09:19,314 --> 01:09:21,531
- What are you doing here? - Avoiding government agents

793
01:09:21,705 --> 01:09:24,139
- Are you here by yourself? - Where'd you get that dress?

794
01:09:24,314 --> 01:09:26,574
It was a birthday present from you, actually

795
01:09:26,748 --> 01:09:28,748
- I have great taste. - Yes

796
01:09:28,923 --> 01:09:32,096
- You, uh, wanna dance? - Oh, no, thank you. No

797
01:09:43,838 --> 01:09:45,838
Am I making you uncomfortable?

798
01:09:46,229 --> 01:09:47,620
No, no

799
01:09:48,230 --> 01:09:50,316
I always forget to wear a deodorant

800
01:09:50,534 --> 01:09:52,838
and dance with my boss in front of everyone

801
01:09:53,056 --> 01:09:54,925
that I work with, in a dress with no back

802
01:09:55,751 --> 01:09:58,273
- You look great, you smell great. - Oh, God

803
01:09:58,448 --> 01:10:00,621
But I could fire you, if that'd take the edge off

804
01:10:00,795 --> 01:10:03,882
I actually don't think that you could tie your shoes without me

805
01:10:04,101 --> 01:10:05,491
- I'd make it a week

806
01:10:05,709 --> 01:10:08,491
Really? What's your social security number?

807
01:10:11,798 --> 01:10:13,449
- Five. - Five?

808
01:10:15,058 --> 01:10:17,928
You're missing just a couple of digits there

809
01:10:18,146 --> 01:10:22,145
The other eight? That's why I got you, for the other eight

810
01:10:33,973 --> 01:10:37,016
- How about a little air? - Yes, I need some air

811
01:10:39,017 --> 01:10:41,060
- That was totally weird. - Totally harmless

812
01:10:41,279 --> 01:10:43,670
It was totally not harmless, by the way

813
01:10:43,844 --> 01:10:46,974
- Nobody was watching us. - Everybody who I work with...

814
01:10:47,192 --> 01:10:50,148
I think you lost objectivity. I think they... we just danced

815
01:10:50,367 --> 01:10:52,192
No, it was not just the dance!

816
01:10:52,410 --> 01:10:54,192
You don't understand because you're you

817
01:10:54,410 --> 01:10:57,628
And everybody knows exactly who you are, and how you are with girls

818
01:10:57,845 --> 01:11:00,106
And all that, which is completely fine...

819
01:11:00,324 --> 01:11:03,498
But you know, then me, you're my boss and I'm dancing...

820
01:11:03,715 --> 01:11:07,020
Because it makes me look like... the one who's trying to...

821
01:11:07,194 --> 01:11:09,672
I just think you're overstating, that's all

822
01:11:09,889 --> 01:11:13,716
And we're here, and then I'm... wearing this ridiculous dress...

823
01:11:14,021 --> 01:11:17,195
And then we were dancing like that and...

824
01:11:30,197 --> 01:11:32,587
- I would like a drink, please. - Got it

825
01:11:34,631 --> 01:11:37,283
I would like a vodka martini, please

826
01:11:37,502 --> 01:11:40,198
Very dry with olives, lot of olives

827
01:11:40,415 --> 01:11:42,415
like at least three olives

828
01:11:43,241 --> 01:11:46,285
Two vodka martinis, extra dry, extra olives, extra fast

829
01:11:46,503 --> 01:11:48,111
Make one of them dirty

830
01:11:53,287 --> 01:11:56,634
- Well... Tony Stark! - Oh, hey!

831
01:11:56,895 --> 01:11:58,677
Fancy seeing you here

832
01:12:02,243 --> 01:12:04,199
- Carrie. - Christine. - That's right

833
01:12:04,505 --> 01:12:06,939
You have a lot of nerve showing up here tonight

834
01:12:07,244 --> 01:12:09,331
Can I at least get a reaction from you?

835
01:12:09,548 --> 01:12:11,330
Panic. I would say panic is my reaction

836
01:12:11,549 --> 01:12:13,331
I was referring to your company's involvement

837
01:12:13,548 --> 01:12:15,419
in this latest atrocity. - They just put my name

838
01:12:15,593 --> 01:12:16,585
on the invitation, I don't know what to tell you

839
01:12:16,654 --> 01:12:19,462
I actually almost bought it, hook, line and sinker

840
01:12:19,681 --> 01:12:21,941
I was out of town for a couple of months, in case you didn't hear

841
01:12:22,159 --> 01:12:23,507
Is this what you call accountability?

842
01:12:23,854 --> 01:12:26,898
It's a town called Gulmira. Heard of it?

843
01:12:38,248 --> 01:12:41,030
- When were these taken? - Yesterday

844
01:12:41,247 --> 01:12:43,638
- I didn't approve any shipment. - Well, your company did

845
01:12:43,813 --> 01:12:45,640
Well, I'm not my company

846
01:12:46,466 --> 01:12:49,248
- Please, do you mind? - Have you seen these pictures?

847
01:12:49,640 --> 01:12:52,988
- What's going on? - Tony, you can't afford to be this naive

848
01:12:53,206 --> 01:12:55,206
I was naive before, when they said:

849
01:12:55,423 --> 01:12:57,988
Here's the line, we don't cross it, this is how we do business

850
01:12:58,206 --> 01:13:01,336
If we're double-dealing under the table... are we?

851
01:13:06,163 --> 01:13:08,206
Let's take a picture. Come on

852
01:13:08,599 --> 01:13:10,077
Picture time!

853
01:13:11,990 --> 01:13:14,772
Tony... who do you think locked you out?

854
01:13:14,990 --> 01:13:18,252
I was the one who filed the injunction against you

855
01:13:20,513 --> 01:13:22,991
It's the only way I can protect you

856
01:13:35,254 --> 01:13:38,036
<i>The fifteen miles hike to the outskirts of Gulmira</i>

857
01:13:38,253 --> 01:13:41,123
<i>can only be described as a 'descent into Hell'.</i>

858
01:13:41,298 --> 01:13:43,515
<i>Into a modern day heart of darkness.</i>

859
01:13:43,732 --> 01:13:46,298
<i>Simple farmers and herders from peaceful villages</i>

860
01:13:46,516 --> 01:13:48,342
<i>have been driven from their homes</i>

861
01:13:48,559 --> 01:13:50,559
<i>displaced from their lands by warlords,</i>

862
01:13:50,777 --> 01:13:52,559
<i>emboldened by a newfound power.</i>

863
01:13:52,864 --> 01:13:54,907
<i>Villagers have been forced to take shelter</i>

864
01:13:55,082 --> 01:13:57,125
<i>in whatever ways that they can find.</i>

865
01:13:57,343 --> 01:13:59,082
<i>In the ruins of other villages</i>

866
01:13:59,430 --> 01:14:02,473
<i>or here, in the remnants of the old Soviet smelting plant.</i>

867
01:14:07,518 --> 01:14:10,091
<i>Recent violence has been attributed to a group</i>

868
01:14:10,126 --> 01:14:13,691
<i>of foreign fighters, referred to by locals as the Ten Rings.</i>

869
01:14:13,909 --> 01:14:17,128
<i>As you can see, these men are heavily armed and on a mission.</i>

870
01:14:17,345 --> 01:14:21,127
<i>A mission that can prove fatal to anyone who stands in their way.</i>

871
01:14:21,564 --> 01:14:24,172
<i>With no political will or international pressure,</i>

872
01:14:24,207 --> 01:14:26,780
<i>there's very little hope for these refugees.</i>

873
01:14:26,999 --> 01:14:29,998
<i>Around me, a woman begging for news on her husband</i>

874
01:14:30,216 --> 01:14:32,215
<i>who was kidnapped by insurgents.</i>

875
01:14:32,434 --> 01:14:33,998
<i>Either forced to join their militia...</i>

876
01:14:39,303 --> 01:14:42,346
<i>...to anyone who will stop a child's simple question:</i>

877
01:14:42,565 --> 01:14:45,043
<i>"Where are my mother and father?"</i>

878
01:14:46,217 --> 01:14:48,696
<i>There's very little hope for these refugees,</i>

879
01:14:48,870 --> 01:14:52,826
<i>refugees who can only wonder who, if anyone, will help.</i>

880
01:16:25,576 --> 01:16:26,793
Faster!

881
01:16:27,011 --> 01:16:29,272
Women on the trucks! The weapons here!

882
01:16:29,489 --> 01:16:31,663
Abandon houses! Hurry up!

883
01:16:39,882 --> 01:16:41,621
Hold this rebel!

884
01:16:43,839 --> 01:16:46,056
Put him with the others

885
01:16:51,492 --> 01:16:52,796
Father!

886
01:16:56,971 --> 01:16:58,579
What the hell is this?

887
01:17:09,885 --> 01:17:11,624
Kill this bastard!

888
01:17:12,059 --> 01:17:13,711
You are incompetent!

889
01:17:16,929 --> 01:17:18,451
Turn your head!

890
01:17:19,929 --> 01:17:21,582
Father!

891
01:18:24,677 --> 01:18:26,458
He is all yours

892
01:19:23,203 --> 01:19:24,900
AIR BASE EDWARDS, CALIFORNIA

893
01:19:25,030 --> 01:19:26,899
- What the hell was that? - Are we clear to go in there?

894
01:19:27,074 --> 01:19:28,291
No, sir. They were using human shields

895
01:19:28,509 --> 01:19:29,726
We never got the green light

896
01:19:29,944 --> 01:19:31,987
Department of State, they're gonna be all over this

897
01:19:32,944 --> 01:19:34,596
We got a bogey

898
01:19:34,770 --> 01:19:36,639
Is CIA on the line?

899
01:19:36,858 --> 01:19:38,945
I got them on line, they wanna know if it's us

900
01:19:39,118 --> 01:19:40,640
No, that definitely is not us, sir

901
01:19:40,814 --> 01:19:42,639
- It wasn't navy. - Wasn't marines

902
01:19:42,814 --> 01:19:45,423
I need answers! Can I please get eyes on target?

903
01:19:46,728 --> 01:19:48,032
Get me colonel Rhodes

904
01:19:48,249 --> 01:19:50,640
from the Weapons development down here now!

905
01:19:56,207 --> 01:19:58,077
We ran an ID check and crossed reference

906
01:19:58,252 --> 01:20:00,077
with all known databases. We have nothing

907
01:20:00,295 --> 01:20:02,077
Any high-altitude surveillance in the region?

908
01:20:02,295 --> 01:20:04,077
We've got an AWAC and a Global Hawk in the area

909
01:20:04,295 --> 01:20:05,773
So this things just appeared out of nowhere?

910
01:20:05,991 --> 01:20:07,513
How come it didn't show up on the Radar?

911
01:20:07,686 --> 01:20:09,468
It's got a minimum Radar cross-section, sir

912
01:20:09,687 --> 01:20:11,512
- Is it stealth? - No, sir. It's tiny

913
01:20:11,730 --> 01:20:13,861
We think it's an unmanned aerial vehicle

914
01:20:14,122 --> 01:20:16,600
Colonel, what are we dealing with here?

915
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:20,470
I'm gonna make a call

916
01:20:25,167 --> 01:20:26,645
- Hello? - Tony?

917
01:20:26,863 --> 01:20:28,603
- Who is this? - It's Rhodes

918
01:20:28,776 --> 01:20:29,949
Sorry, hello?

919
01:20:30,124 --> 01:20:31,994
- I said it's Rhodes. - Speak up, please

920
01:20:32,125 --> 01:20:35,342
- What the hell is that noise? - I'm driving with the top down

921
01:20:35,559 --> 01:20:37,255
Yeah, well I need your help right now

922
01:20:37,472 --> 01:20:39,080
It's funny how that works, huh?

923
01:20:39,255 --> 01:20:41,342
Yeah, speaking of funny, we got a weapons depot

924
01:20:41,516 --> 01:20:43,429
that was just blown up a few cliques from where

925
01:20:43,646 --> 01:20:45,428
you've been held captive. - Well, that's a hot spot

926
01:20:45,647 --> 01:20:48,255
Sounds like someone stepped in and did you job for you

927
01:20:48,430 --> 01:20:50,125
Why do you sound out of breath, Tony?

928
01:20:50,343 --> 01:20:52,342
- I was just jogging at the canyon. - I thought you were driving

929
01:20:52,517 --> 01:20:54,517
Right, I was driving to the canyon where I'm gonna jog

930
01:20:54,735 --> 01:20:56,518
Are you sure you don't have any tech in that area...

931
01:20:56,736 --> 01:20:57,952
...I should know about? - Nope

932
01:20:58,127 --> 01:20:59,779
Bogey spotted!

933
01:20:59,954 --> 01:21:02,041
Okay, good, cause I'm staring at one right now

934
01:21:02,258 --> 01:21:04,475
and it's about to be blown to kingdom come

935
01:21:12,042 --> 01:21:15,215
War room, this is Whiplash One. I've got the bogey in my sight

936
01:21:15,738 --> 01:21:18,563
- Whiplash One, what is it? - I've got no idea

937
01:21:18,651 --> 01:21:20,738
- You have radio contact? - Non responsive, sir

938
01:21:20,955 --> 01:21:22,737
Then you are clear to engage

939
01:21:29,957 --> 01:21:32,609
Bogey just went supersonic. I got a lock!

940
01:21:37,218 --> 01:21:39,217
Incoming missile. - Flairs!

941
01:21:42,001 --> 01:21:44,348
Wait a second! Bogey deployed flairs

942
01:21:58,829 --> 01:22:00,263
Deploy flaps!

943
01:22:01,612 --> 01:22:04,003
Holly... this thing just drove off the Radar, sir!

944
01:22:04,178 --> 01:22:06,003
Satellite image has been lost

945
01:22:06,221 --> 01:22:08,568
- No way that's the U.A.V. - What is it?

946
01:22:08,787 --> 01:22:10,612
I can't see anything

947
01:22:10,831 --> 01:22:13,309
Whatever it was, it just bought the farm

948
01:22:13,744 --> 01:22:15,787
I think bogey has been handled, sir

949
01:22:25,701 --> 01:22:27,789
- Hello? - Hi, Rhodey, it's me. - It's who?

950
01:22:28,006 --> 01:22:30,876
I'm sorry, it IS me. You asked what that was, and it was me

951
01:22:31,051 --> 01:22:33,789
No, see.. this isn't a game. You do not send civilian equipment

952
01:22:34,006 --> 01:22:36,397
into my active war zone. You understand that?

953
01:22:36,616 --> 01:22:40,050
It's not a piece of equipment. I am in it. It's a suit. It's me!

954
01:22:40,399 --> 01:22:42,398
Rhodey, you got anything for me?

955
01:22:44,269 --> 01:22:47,486
Mark your position and return to base. - Roger that

956
01:22:49,704 --> 01:22:52,791
On your belly! It looks like a... man!

957
01:22:53,008 --> 01:22:55,617
Shake him off! Move, move!

958
01:23:03,662 --> 01:23:05,662
I'm hit! I'm hit!

959
01:23:11,533 --> 01:23:13,315
Eject! Eject!

960
01:23:19,925 --> 01:23:21,750
Whiplash One down

961
01:23:21,924 --> 01:23:25,359
- Whiplash 2, do you see a chute? - Negative! No chute! No chute!

962
01:23:31,274 --> 01:23:33,317
My chute's jammed!

963
01:23:38,014 --> 01:23:40,318
Sir, I've got a visual on a bogey

964
01:23:40,579 --> 01:23:44,057
Whiplash 2, reengage. If you get a clear shot, you take it!

965
01:23:45,362 --> 01:23:48,318
Major, we don't even know what we're shooting at. Call off the Raptors

966
01:23:48,579 --> 01:23:51,535
That thing just took out an F-22 inside the legal no-fly zone

967
01:23:51,666 --> 01:23:53,666
Whiplash 2, if you have a clear shot, take it

968
01:23:53,884 --> 01:23:56,363
They've been reengaged. Execute evasive maneuver

969
01:23:56,580 --> 01:23:57,753
Keep going!

970
01:24:05,103 --> 01:24:07,625
Got a chute! Got a chute!

971
01:24:14,669 --> 01:24:17,669
- Tony, are you still there? - Hey, thanks

972
01:24:17,844 --> 01:24:20,670
Oh my God, you crazy son of a bitch!

973
01:24:20,887 --> 01:24:23,234
You owe me a plane, you know that, right?

974
01:24:24,192 --> 01:24:26,800
Yeah, well, technically he hit me, so...

975
01:24:27,018 --> 01:24:29,757
Now are you gonna come by and see what I'm working on? - No, no

976
01:24:29,932 --> 01:24:31,541
The less I know the better

977
01:24:31,758 --> 01:24:33,758
Now what am I supposed to tell to the press?

978
01:24:33,933 --> 01:24:35,888
Training exercise. Isn't that the usual BS?

979
01:24:36,107 --> 01:24:37,889
It's not that simple

980
01:24:38,325 --> 01:24:40,280
An unfortunate training exercise

981
01:24:40,499 --> 01:24:43,325
involving an F-22 Raptor occurred yesterday

982
01:24:43,542 --> 01:24:46,586
I'm pleased to report that the pilot was not injured

983
01:24:47,195 --> 01:24:51,021
As for the unexpected turn of events on the ground in Gulmira

984
01:24:51,238 --> 01:24:54,759
it is still unclear who or what intervened

985
01:24:54,934 --> 01:24:58,760
but I can assure you that the U.S. government was not involved

986
01:25:03,936 --> 01:25:06,632
Oh, it isn't that bad, sir

987
01:25:06,893 --> 01:25:09,980
Sir, the more you struggle, the more this is going to hurt

988
01:25:10,154 --> 01:25:12,153
Be gentle, this is my first time

989
01:25:12,719 --> 01:25:14,675
I designed this to come off

990
01:25:19,155 --> 01:25:21,198
Please try not to move

991
01:25:22,285 --> 01:25:24,372
What's going on here?

992
01:25:28,764 --> 01:25:32,244
Let's face it, this is not the worst thing you've caught me doing

993
01:25:33,548 --> 01:25:35,809
Are those bullet holes?

994
01:26:02,986 --> 01:26:04,638
Welcome

995
01:26:07,551 --> 01:26:10,073
Compliments of Tony Stark

996
01:26:10,464 --> 01:26:14,029
If you killed him when you were supposed to, you'd still have a face

997
01:26:14,204 --> 01:26:16,465
You paid us trinkets to kill a prince

998
01:26:16,682 --> 01:26:18,725
Show me the weapon

999
01:26:19,553 --> 01:26:22,944
Come. Leave your guards outside

1000
01:26:39,685 --> 01:26:42,685
His escape bore unexpected fruit

1001
01:26:44,903 --> 01:26:47,163
So this is how he did it

1002
01:26:47,598 --> 01:26:51,816
This is only a first crude effort. Stark has perfected his design

1003
01:26:52,643 --> 01:26:55,817
He has made a masterpiece of death

1004
01:26:55,990 --> 01:26:59,469
A man with a dozen of these can rule all of Asia

1005
01:27:00,643 --> 01:27:04,035
And you dream of Stark's throne

1006
01:27:04,688 --> 01:27:07,210
We have a common enemy

1007
01:27:11,428 --> 01:27:13,906
We are still in business

1008
01:27:15,820 --> 01:27:18,081
I will give you these designs...

1009
01:27:19,558 --> 01:27:21,254
...as a gift

1010
01:27:22,124 --> 01:27:24,167
And in return...

1011
01:27:25,342 --> 01:27:30,081
...I hope you repay me with a gift of iron soldiers

1012
01:27:41,431 --> 01:27:44,474
This is the only gift you will receive

1013
01:27:47,431 --> 01:27:48,996
Technology

1014
01:27:50,606 --> 01:27:54,562
That's always been your Achilles heel in this part of the world

1015
01:27:55,476 --> 01:27:58,954
Don't worry. It will only last for 15 minutes

1016
01:27:59,607 --> 01:28:02,694
That's the least of your problems

1017
01:28:07,347 --> 01:28:10,217
Bring the armour and the rest of it

1018
01:28:11,608 --> 01:28:13,999
Alright, lets finish up here

1019
01:28:17,565 --> 01:28:20,347
Set up Sector 16 underneath the Arc reactor

1020
01:28:20,522 --> 01:28:24,174
And I want this dead and masked. Recruit our top engineers

1021
01:28:24,348 --> 01:28:26,391
I want a prototype right away

1022
01:28:35,262 --> 01:28:36,697
Are you busy?

1023
01:28:37,393 --> 01:28:40,872
I need you to go to my office and hack into the mainframe

1024
01:28:41,089 --> 01:28:44,133
You're gonna retrieve all the recent shipping manifests

1025
01:28:44,307 --> 01:28:46,872
This is a lock chip, this will get you in

1026
01:28:47,090 --> 01:28:49,525
It's probably under Executive Files, if not...

1027
01:28:49,655 --> 01:28:52,090
they put it on a ghost drive, in which case you need to look

1028
01:28:52,308 --> 01:28:54,004
for the lowest numeric heading

1029
01:28:54,177 --> 01:28:56,482
And what do you plan to do with this information

1030
01:28:56,699 --> 01:28:58,090
if I bring it back here? - Same drill

1031
01:28:58,265 --> 01:29:00,482
They've been dealing under the table, I'm gonna stop them

1032
01:29:00,613 --> 01:29:03,612
I'm gonna find my weapons and destroy them

1033
01:29:04,047 --> 01:29:05,655
Tony...

1034
01:29:07,353 --> 01:29:10,179
you know that I would help you with anything

1035
01:29:10,354 --> 01:29:13,441
but I can not help you if you're gonna start all of this again

1036
01:29:13,658 --> 01:29:17,005
There is nothing except this. There's no art openings

1037
01:29:17,224 --> 01:29:20,615
there's no benefit, there's nothing to sign

1038
01:29:21,529 --> 01:29:25,050
There's the next mission, and nothing else

1039
01:29:26,224 --> 01:29:28,267
Is that so?

1040
01:29:29,486 --> 01:29:31,529
Well, then I quit

1041
01:29:33,790 --> 01:29:35,746
You stood by my side all these years

1042
01:29:35,964 --> 01:29:38,443
while I reaped the benefits of destruction

1043
01:29:38,792 --> 01:29:40,791
And now that I'm trying to protect the people

1044
01:29:40,966 --> 01:29:42,791
that I've put in harm's way, your going to walk out?

1045
01:29:42,965 --> 01:29:46,965
You're gonna kill yourself, Tony. I'm not gonna be a part of it

1046
01:29:47,488 --> 01:29:51,705
I shouldn't be alive... unless it was for a reason

1047
01:29:53,619 --> 01:29:55,662
I'm not crazy, Pepper

1048
01:29:55,880 --> 01:29:59,140
I just finally know what I have to do

1049
01:30:03,271 --> 01:30:06,793
And I know in my heart that it's right

1050
01:30:21,970 --> 01:30:24,404
You're all I have too, you know

1051
01:31:33,847 --> 01:31:35,846
Sector 16?

1052
01:31:37,020 --> 01:31:39,020
What are you up to, Obadiah?

1053
01:31:51,588 --> 01:31:54,544
You did not tell us that the target you paid us to kill

1054
01:31:54,762 --> 01:31:57,066
was the great Tony Stark. As you can see

1055
01:31:57,284 --> 01:32:00,240
Obadiah Stane, your deception and lies will cost you dearly

1056
01:32:00,414 --> 01:32:03,370
The price to kill Tony Stark has just gone up

1057
01:32:07,415 --> 01:32:11,242
So... what are we gonna do about this?

1058
01:32:23,287 --> 01:32:26,896
I know what you're going through, Pepper

1059
01:32:34,723 --> 01:32:38,244
Ah, Tony. He always gets the good stuff, doesn't he?

1060
01:32:59,726 --> 01:33:01,899
I was so happy...

1061
01:33:03,204 --> 01:33:07,508
when he came home. It was like we got him back from the dead

1062
01:33:10,161 --> 01:33:12,293
And now I realise...

1063
01:33:14,597 --> 01:33:18,467
...well, Tony never really did come home, did he?

1064
01:33:19,249 --> 01:33:22,336
He left a part of himself in that cave

1065
01:33:24,858 --> 01:33:26,901
Breaks my heart

1066
01:33:28,512 --> 01:33:29,816
Well...

1067
01:33:30,946 --> 01:33:33,207
He is a complicated person

1068
01:33:35,425 --> 01:33:39,251
He's been through a lot. I think he'll be alright

1069
01:33:45,383 --> 01:33:48,383
You are a very rare woman

1070
01:33:50,470 --> 01:33:53,079
Tony doesn't know how lucky he is

1071
01:33:55,209 --> 01:33:57,426
Thank you. Thanks

1072
01:33:59,514 --> 01:34:01,514
I gotta get back there

1073
01:34:06,776 --> 01:34:09,167
Is that today's paper?

1074
01:34:10,428 --> 01:34:11,688
Yes

1075
01:34:12,298 --> 01:34:15,125
- Do you mind? - Not at all

1076
01:34:15,343 --> 01:34:17,647
- Puzzle. - Of course

1077
01:34:20,995 --> 01:34:22,865
Take care

1078
01:34:46,215 --> 01:34:48,084
Ms. Potts? We had an appointment

1079
01:34:48,172 --> 01:34:50,128
Did you forget about our appointment?

1080
01:34:50,302 --> 01:34:53,041
Nope. Right now, come with me

1081
01:34:55,086 --> 01:34:58,129
I'll give you the meeting of your life. Your office

1082
01:34:59,173 --> 01:35:01,738
We've been working our best

1083
01:35:02,260 --> 01:35:05,304
Absolutely, we're... I'm gonna have to call you back

1084
01:35:05,956 --> 01:35:09,130
Mr. Stane? Sir, we've explored what you've asked us

1085
01:35:09,347 --> 01:35:12,173
and it seems as though there's a little hiccup, actually...

1086
01:35:12,392 --> 01:35:14,697
- A hiccup? - Yes, to power the suit...

1087
01:35:14,871 --> 01:35:17,305
sir, the technology actually doesn't exist. So it's...

1088
01:35:17,566 --> 01:35:19,566
Wait, wait, the technology?

1089
01:35:20,046 --> 01:35:23,263
William, here is the technology

1090
01:35:23,741 --> 01:35:26,220
I've asked you to simply make it smaller

1091
01:35:26,437 --> 01:35:28,784
Okay, sir, that's what we're trying to do

1092
01:35:29,003 --> 01:35:31,002
but honestly, it's impossible

1093
01:35:31,176 --> 01:35:34,481
Tony Stark was able to build this in a cave!

1094
01:35:35,003 --> 01:35:37,394
With a box of scraps!

1095
01:35:39,003 --> 01:35:42,481
I'm sorry. I'm not Tony Stark

1096
01:35:58,180 --> 01:35:59,570
Tony?

1097
01:36:01,962 --> 01:36:03,788
Tony, are you there?

1098
01:36:07,006 --> 01:36:08,354
Breathe

1099
01:36:09,268 --> 01:36:11,702
Easy, easy...

1100
01:36:14,224 --> 01:36:16,833
You remember this one, right?

1101
01:36:17,921 --> 01:36:20,443
It's a shame the government didn't approve

1102
01:36:20,660 --> 01:36:24,530
There are so many applications regarding short-term paralysis

1103
01:36:26,443 --> 01:36:28,095
Ah, Tony

1104
01:36:30,661 --> 01:36:34,661
When I ordered the hit on you

1105
01:36:37,444 --> 01:36:40,096
I was worried that I was...

1106
01:36:43,010 --> 01:36:45,748
...killing the golden goose

1107
01:36:46,620 --> 01:36:48,663
But, you see...

1108
01:36:49,446 --> 01:36:53,489
it was just fate that you survived it

1109
01:36:59,012 --> 01:37:02,838
leaving one last golden egg to give

1110
01:37:07,143 --> 01:37:10,621
You really think that just because you have an idea

1111
01:37:10,839 --> 01:37:12,838
it belongs to you?

1112
01:37:16,144 --> 01:37:20,406
Your father, he helped to give us the atomic bomb

1113
01:37:20,580 --> 01:37:23,579
Now what kind of world would it be today

1114
01:37:23,798 --> 01:37:25,797
if he was as selfish as you?

1115
01:37:35,624 --> 01:37:37,711
Oh, it's beautiful

1116
01:37:40,059 --> 01:37:41,667
Ah, Tony...

1117
01:37:43,060 --> 01:37:45,582
This is your Ninth Symphony

1118
01:37:46,930 --> 01:37:49,800
What a masterpiece! Look at that

1119
01:37:50,800 --> 01:37:53,017
This is your legacy

1120
01:37:55,235 --> 01:37:58,061
The generation of weapons...

1121
01:37:58,714 --> 01:38:01,148
...with this at its heart

1122
01:38:03,454 --> 01:38:07,280
The weapons that will help stir the world back on course

1123
01:38:07,497 --> 01:38:10,279
With the balance of power in our hands

1124
01:38:11,280 --> 01:38:13,324
In the right hands

1125
01:38:16,107 --> 01:38:20,585
I wish you could see my prototype

1126
01:38:22,108 --> 01:38:27,282
It's not as... not as conservative as yours

1127
01:38:29,717 --> 01:38:32,499
Too bad you had to involve Pepper in this

1128
01:38:33,066 --> 01:38:35,630
I would've preferred that she lived

1129
01:38:48,588 --> 01:38:50,676
What do you mean he paid to have Tony killed?

1130
01:38:50,894 --> 01:38:52,719
Pepper, slow down

1131
01:38:52,938 --> 01:38:56,025
Why would Obadiah... okay, where is Tony now?

1132
01:38:56,199 --> 01:38:58,416
I don't know, he's not answering his phone

1133
01:38:58,633 --> 01:39:00,764
Please go there and make sure everything's okay

1134
01:39:00,938 --> 01:39:03,417
Thank you, Rhodey. I know a shortcut

1135
01:40:09,336 --> 01:40:10,944
Good boy

1136
01:40:50,471 --> 01:40:51,644
Tony?

1137
01:40:54,212 --> 01:40:55,776
Tony?

1138
01:40:57,125 --> 01:40:58,473
Tony?

1139
01:41:04,168 --> 01:41:05,429
Tony!

1140
01:41:08,864 --> 01:41:11,299
- Are you okay? - Where is Pepper?

1141
01:41:12,039 --> 01:41:15,735
She's fine. She's with five agents that are about to arrest Obadiah

1142
01:41:16,343 --> 01:41:18,343
That's not gonna be enough

1143
01:41:42,302 --> 01:41:44,128
Section 16

1144
01:41:45,085 --> 01:41:46,781
Section 16...

1145
01:41:47,433 --> 01:41:48,955
There it is

1146
01:41:57,304 --> 01:41:59,739
My key's not working, it's not opening the door

1147
01:42:00,001 --> 01:42:02,436
Wow, what is that? It's like a little device, like a thing

1148
01:42:02,653 --> 01:42:05,914
that's gonna pick the lock? -You may wanna take few steps back

1149
01:42:25,221 --> 01:42:28,482
That's the coolest thing I've ever seen. - Not bad, huh?

1150
01:42:29,830 --> 01:42:31,438
Let's do it

1151
01:42:37,395 --> 01:42:39,700
You need me to do anything else?

1152
01:42:40,135 --> 01:42:42,091
Keep the skies clear

1153
01:42:46,918 --> 01:42:48,396
Damn!

1154
01:42:56,181 --> 01:42:58,180
Next time, baby

1155
01:43:28,227 --> 01:43:30,053
Looks like you were right

1156
01:43:30,402 --> 01:43:32,053
He was building a suit

1157
01:43:32,271 --> 01:43:34,227
I thought it'll be bigger

1158
01:44:19,058 --> 01:44:20,493
Take him out!

1159
01:44:30,800 --> 01:44:33,278
How do you think the Mark One chest piece is gonna hold up?

1160
01:44:33,452 --> 01:44:35,321
48% power and falling, sir

1161
01:44:35,539 --> 01:44:38,495
That chest piece was never designed for sustained flight

1162
01:44:38,713 --> 01:44:40,277
Keep me posted

1163
01:44:41,583 --> 01:44:43,017
- Pepper. - Tony?

1164
01:44:43,235 --> 01:44:45,148
- Tony, are you okay? - I'm fine

1165
01:44:45,366 --> 01:44:47,627
- Obadiah, he's gone insane. - I know. Listen!

1166
01:44:47,844 --> 01:44:50,017
- You better get outta there! - He built the suit

1167
01:44:50,236 --> 01:44:51,670
Get outta there, right now!

1168
01:45:02,760 --> 01:45:05,151
Where do you think you're going?

1169
01:45:10,760 --> 01:45:13,412
Your services are no longer required

1170
01:45:14,152 --> 01:45:15,412
Stane!

1171
01:45:40,677 --> 01:45:43,198
- I love this suit! - Put them down

1172
01:45:43,416 --> 01:45:45,720
Collateral damage, Tony

1173
01:45:47,024 --> 01:45:49,241
Defer the power to chest piece

1174
01:45:58,112 --> 01:46:00,244
Power reduced to 19%

1175
01:46:07,636 --> 01:46:08,940
Lady!

1176
01:46:35,508 --> 01:46:38,682
For thirty years, I've been holding you up

1177
01:46:42,509 --> 01:46:45,378
I built this company from nothing!

1178
01:46:47,118 --> 01:46:50,031
And nothing is gonna stand in my way

1179
01:46:55,988 --> 01:46:58,510
And least of all, you

1180
01:47:08,077 --> 01:47:10,947
Impressive! You upgraded your armour

1181
01:47:11,164 --> 01:47:14,164
I've made some upgrades of my own

1182
01:47:22,426 --> 01:47:24,425
Sir, it appears that his suit can fly

1183
01:47:24,644 --> 01:47:26,687
Duly noted. Take me to the maximum altitude

1184
01:47:26,861 --> 01:47:29,295
With only 15% power, the odds of reaching that altitude...

1185
01:47:29,514 --> 01:47:31,471
I know the math! Do it!

1186
01:47:39,211 --> 01:47:41,907
Sir, you're not gonna believe this. That thing is back

1187
01:47:42,081 --> 01:47:44,471
Get me major Allen. Scramble the jets!

1188
01:47:46,951 --> 01:47:50,211
Not necessary, people, just the training exercise

1189
01:47:59,604 --> 01:48:01,865
- 13% power, sir. - Climb!

1190
01:48:05,519 --> 01:48:07,692
-11%. - Keep going!

1191
01:48:14,475 --> 01:48:17,692
- 7% power. - Just leave it on the screen, stop telling me

1192
01:48:27,780 --> 01:48:29,345
You had a great idea, Tony

1193
01:48:29,563 --> 01:48:32,346
but my suit is more advanced in every way!

1194
01:48:32,565 --> 01:48:34,912
How'd you solve the icing problem?

1195
01:48:35,043 --> 01:48:36,651
Icing problem?

1196
01:48:38,652 --> 01:48:40,565
Might want to look into it

1197
01:48:52,653 --> 01:48:54,043
2%

1198
01:48:56,131 --> 01:48:59,174
We are now running on emergency backup power

1199
01:49:10,568 --> 01:49:11,872
- Potts! - Tony!

1200
01:49:12,090 --> 01:49:14,133
Oh my God, are you okay?

1201
01:49:14,308 --> 01:49:17,351
I'm almost dead of power, I gotta get out of this thing

1202
01:49:17,526 --> 01:49:20,264
I'll be right there. - Nice try

1203
01:49:32,570 --> 01:49:34,353
Weapons status?

1204
01:49:34,571 --> 01:49:36,788
Repulsors are off line

1205
01:49:40,833 --> 01:49:42,223
Flairs!

1206
01:49:50,920 --> 01:49:53,225
Very clever, Tony

1207
01:49:58,268 --> 01:50:00,138
- Potts. - Tony!

1208
01:50:00,355 --> 01:50:02,963
This isn't working, we're gonna have to overload the reactor

1209
01:50:03,182 --> 01:50:05,835
and blast the roof. - How are you gonna do that?

1210
01:50:06,053 --> 01:50:07,269
You're gonna do it

1211
01:50:07,488 --> 01:50:09,487
Go to the central console, open up bolt of circuits

1212
01:50:09,662 --> 01:50:11,488
When I clear the roof I'll let you know

1213
01:50:11,705 --> 01:50:13,878
and you're gonna hit the master bypass button

1214
01:50:14,141 --> 01:50:16,358
That's gonna fry everything up here

1215
01:50:17,532 --> 01:50:19,314
Okay, I am going in now

1216
01:50:19,532 --> 01:50:23,402
Make sure you wait till I clear the roof, I'll buy you some time

1217
01:50:32,750 --> 01:50:34,924
This looks important

1218
01:50:55,232 --> 01:50:58,275
I never had a taste for this sort of thing

1219
01:50:58,493 --> 01:51:02,319
but I must admit, I'm deeply enjoying the suit

1220
01:51:10,842 --> 01:51:13,841
You finally outdid yourself, Tony

1221
01:51:15,669 --> 01:51:18,407
It would've made your father proud

1222
01:51:22,582 --> 01:51:25,364
It's ready, Tony! Get off the roof!

1223
01:51:44,497 --> 01:51:45,975
Tony!

1224
01:51:47,107 --> 01:51:49,106
How ironic, Tony!

1225
01:51:50,585 --> 01:51:53,107
Trying to free the world of weapons

1226
01:51:53,324 --> 01:51:55,585
you gave it the best one ever!

1227
01:51:55,803 --> 01:51:57,976
- Pepper! - And now...

1228
01:51:59,499 --> 01:52:01,889
I'm gonna kill you with it!

1229
01:52:04,542 --> 01:52:07,195
You ripped up my targeting system

1230
01:52:07,370 --> 01:52:10,196
- Hit the button! - You told me not to!

1231
01:52:10,501 --> 01:52:12,588
Hold still, you little prick

1232
01:52:14,588 --> 01:52:17,153
- Just do it! - You'll die!

1233
01:52:20,415 --> 01:52:21,805
Push it!

1234
01:53:19,116 --> 01:53:20,638
Tony!

1235
01:53:29,247 --> 01:53:31,291
We've all received the official statement

1236
01:53:31,509 --> 01:53:34,117
of what occurred at Stark Industries last night

1237
01:53:34,335 --> 01:53:37,726
There have been unconfirmed reports that a robotic prototype

1238
01:53:37,901 --> 01:53:41,119
malfunctioned and caused damage to the Arc reactor

1239
01:53:44,380 --> 01:53:46,684
"Iron Man", that's kinda catchy. It's got a nice ring to it

1240
01:53:46,902 --> 01:53:49,945
It's not technically accurate, since it's a gold-titanium alloy

1241
01:53:50,164 --> 01:53:52,772
but it's kinda attractive name anyway

1242
01:53:52,989 --> 01:53:54,771
Here is your alibi

1243
01:53:55,772 --> 01:53:58,207
- Okay. - You were on your yacht

1244
01:53:58,468 --> 01:54:00,729
We told Pepper to put you in Avalon all night

1245
01:54:00,904 --> 01:54:03,164
and sworn statements from 50 of your guests

1246
01:54:03,382 --> 01:54:06,338
I was thinking maybe we should say it was just Pepper and me

1247
01:54:06,555 --> 01:54:08,337
alone on the island

1248
01:54:09,338 --> 01:54:12,687
That's what happened. Just read it word for word

1249
01:54:14,644 --> 01:54:16,644
There's nothing about Stane here

1250
01:54:16,819 --> 01:54:19,644
That's been handled. He's on vacation

1251
01:54:19,906 --> 01:54:22,949
Small aircraft have such a poor safety record

1252
01:54:23,167 --> 01:54:25,862
What about this whole story that it's a body guard?

1253
01:54:26,080 --> 01:54:28,558
He's my body...? That's kinda flimsy

1254
01:54:28,733 --> 01:54:31,037
This isn't my first rodeo, Mr. Stark

1255
01:54:31,255 --> 01:54:34,819
Just stick to the official statement and soon this will all be behind you

1256
01:54:35,124 --> 01:54:37,471
You've got 90 seconds

1257
01:54:40,342 --> 01:54:42,125
Oh, agent Coulson

1258
01:54:42,560 --> 01:54:46,560
I just wanted to say thank you very much for all of your help

1259
01:54:46,952 --> 01:54:50,126
That's what we do. You'll be hearing from us

1260
01:54:50,343 --> 01:54:53,734
- From the Strategic Homeland... - Just call us S.H.I.E.L.D

1261
01:54:53,909 --> 01:54:55,387
Right

1262
01:54:56,171 --> 01:54:59,300
- Lets get the show on the road. - You know, it's actually...

1263
01:54:59,518 --> 01:55:02,431
...not that bad... even I don't think I'm Iron Man

1264
01:55:02,562 --> 01:55:04,432
- You're not Iron Man. - Yeah I am

1265
01:55:04,605 --> 01:55:06,431
- You're not. - Suite yourself

1266
01:55:06,736 --> 01:55:09,127
If I were Iron Man, I'd have this girlfriend

1267
01:55:09,301 --> 01:55:11,737
who knew my true identity. She'd be a wreck

1268
01:55:11,954 --> 01:55:14,345
She'd always be worrying that I was gonna die

1269
01:55:14,564 --> 01:55:16,998
and yet proud of a man I become. She'd be...

1270
01:55:17,173 --> 01:55:20,346
wildly conflicted, which would only make her more...

1271
01:55:21,303 --> 01:55:24,259
crazy about me. Tell me you never think about that night?

1272
01:55:24,391 --> 01:55:26,434
- What night? - You know

1273
01:55:28,956 --> 01:55:32,608
Are you talking about... the night that we danced

1274
01:55:33,217 --> 01:55:35,782
and went up to the roof...

1275
01:55:36,392 --> 01:55:37,782
and then...

1276
01:55:38,783 --> 01:55:42,828
you went downstairs to get me a drink, and you...

1277
01:55:43,654 --> 01:55:46,001
left me there by myself?

1278
01:55:46,306 --> 01:55:48,871
Is that the night you're talking about?

1279
01:55:51,220 --> 01:55:53,002
I thought so

1280
01:55:54,960 --> 01:55:58,656
- Will that be all, Mr. Stark? - Yes, that'd be all, Ms. Potts

1281
01:55:58,872 --> 01:56:01,959
And now Mr. Stark has prepared a statement

1282
01:56:02,308 --> 01:56:05,481
He will not be taking any questions, thank you

1283
01:56:08,699 --> 01:56:11,743
It's been a while since I was in front of you

1284
01:56:11,960 --> 01:56:14,743
I figure I'll stick to the cards this time

1285
01:56:16,353 --> 01:56:18,744
There's been speculation that I was involved in the events

1286
01:56:18,962 --> 01:56:20,961
that occurred on a freeway and the rooftop...

1287
01:56:21,180 --> 01:56:24,267
I'm sorry Mr. Stark, but do you honestly expect us to believe that

1288
01:56:24,397 --> 01:56:27,440
that was a bodyguard in a suit, that conveniently appeared

1289
01:56:27,615 --> 01:56:30,484
despite the fact that... - I know that it's confusing...

1290
01:56:30,788 --> 01:56:33,614
It is one thing to question the official story

1291
01:56:33,833 --> 01:56:36,006
and another entirely to make wild accusations

1292
01:56:36,225 --> 01:56:38,006
or insinuate that I'm a superhero

1293
01:56:38,224 --> 01:56:40,658
- I never said you're a superhero. - You didn't?

1294
01:56:40,833 --> 01:56:43,878
Well, good, because that would be outlandish and...

1295
01:56:44,183 --> 01:56:45,878
...fantastic

1296
01:56:48,356 --> 01:56:51,921
I'm just not the hero type, clearly. With this...

1297
01:56:52,443 --> 01:56:55,269
long list of character defects and all the mistakes I've made

1298
01:56:55,444 --> 01:56:57,313
largely in public

1299
01:56:57,922 --> 01:57:00,531
- Just stick to the cards. - Yeah, okay

1300
01:57:02,662 --> 01:57:04,531
The truth is...

1301
01:57:10,314 --> 01:57:12,749
I am Iron Man

1302
02:05:14,657 --> 02:05:18,306
Jarvis? - Welcome home, sir

1303
02:05:21,539 --> 02:05:23,375
I am Iron Man

1304
02:05:24,628 --> 02:05:26,962
You think you're the only Superhero in the world?

1305
02:05:27,484 --> 02:05:32,175
We are part a bigger universe, yet we know nothing

1306
02:05:32,697 --> 02:05:34,260
Who the hell are you?

1307
02:05:35,305 --> 02:05:37,390
Nick Fury, the Director of SHIELD

1308
02:05:38,434 --> 02:05:39,476
Oh

1309
02:05:39,999 --> 02:05:42,605
I'm here to talk to you about the Avenger Initiative
