1
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:16,764
Do you know what time it is?

2
00:02:17,404 --> 00:02:18,394
Can't sleep.

3
00:02:18,572 --> 00:02:20,438
There are tabs for that.

4
00:02:20,907 --> 00:02:22,636
Yeah, but then I'd be sleeping.

5
00:02:23,176 --> 00:02:24,735
Dreams again?

6
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,583
Wanna fight?

7
00:02:34,121 --> 00:02:35,111
I slipped.

8
00:02:35,288 --> 00:02:36,346
Right, you slipped

9
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:38,083
as a result of me
punching you in the face.

10
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:39,181
I was already slipping

11
00:02:39,292 --> 00:02:40,316
when you happened
to punch me in the face.

12
00:02:40,427 --> 00:02:41,917
The two events were not related.

13
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:43,619
Tell me about this dream.

14
00:02:46,433 --> 00:02:48,663
Anything new?
- No.

15
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,474
You have to let go of the past.

16
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:55,802
I don't remember my past.

17
00:02:55,976 --> 00:02:57,466
It's causing you doubt,

18
00:02:57,544 --> 00:02:59,308
and doubt makes you vulnerable.

19
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:08,545
Control it.

20
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,324
Lose control again,
and you'll have to commune

21
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:13,826
with the Supreme Intelligence.

22
00:03:13,994 --> 00:03:16,827
There's nothing more dangerous
to a warrior than emotion.

23
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:21,957
Humor is a distraction.

24
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:26,131
And anger?

25
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:27,731
Anger only serves the enemy.

26
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:40,483
<i>One hundred twenty days</i>

27
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:42,420
<i>since the last Skrull attack.</i>

28
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:43,920
<i>Has anyone ever seen</i>

29
00:03:44,024 --> 00:03:45,651
what the Supreme Intelligence
really looks like?

30
00:03:45,826 --> 00:03:48,420
No one can look upon
the Supreme Intelligence

31
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:49,859
in its true form.

32
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:52,165
You know that.

33
00:03:52,999 --> 00:03:55,491
Our subconscious chooses
the way they appear to us.

34
00:03:55,669 --> 00:03:58,900
So it's sacred. It's personal.

35
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,904
No Kree divulges it, ever.

36
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,231
Who do you see?

37
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:04,266
- Your brother?
- No.

38
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:05,605
- Father?

39
00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:07,838
- Your old commander?
- Vers.

40
00:04:08,014 --> 00:04:09,243
It's me you see, isn't it?

41
00:04:10,684 --> 00:04:12,083
I see what you're trying to do.

42
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,686
- Is it working'?
- Yes.

43
00:04:13,854 --> 00:04:15,515
But you won't succeed
in changing the subject.

44
00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:18,021
What is the point of
giving me these...

45
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:19,886
if you don't want me
to use them'?

46
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,721
I want you to use them.

47
00:04:21,895 --> 00:04:23,590
The Supreme Intelligence
gave me a responsibility...

48
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:25,562
of showing you how to use them.

49
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:26,722
I know how.

50
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,858
Yeah, if that were true,
you'd be able to

51
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:28,924
knock me down without them.

52
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,700
Control your impulses.

53
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:36,106
Stop using this,
start using this.

54
00:04:36,877 --> 00:04:40,871
I want you to be
the best version of yourself.

55
00:05:21,922 --> 00:05:23,083
<i>Vers.</i>

56
00:05:24,024 --> 00:05:25,651
Intelligence.

57
00:05:26,026 --> 00:05:28,961
Your commander insists
that you're fit to serve.

58
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:30,153
I am.

59
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:33,667
You struggle
with your emotions...

60
00:05:34,201 --> 00:05:36,670
with your past,
which fuels them.

61
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:41,430
You are just one victim
of the Skrull expansion...

62
00:05:41,608 --> 00:05:44,669
that has threatened our
civilization for centuries.

63
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:47,780
Imposters
who silently infiltrate...

64
00:05:47,948 --> 00:05:49,939
then take over our planets.

65
00:05:51,718 --> 00:05:53,379
Horrors that you remember...

66
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:56,113
and so much that you do not.

67
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:03,456
It's all blank.
My life.

68
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:05,155
You're supposed to take the form

69
00:06:05,232 --> 00:06:06,893
of who I most admire...

70
00:06:07,067 --> 00:06:11,470
but I don't even remember
who this person was to me.

71
00:06:11,638 --> 00:06:13,629
Perhaps this is a mercy

72
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:16,039
sparing you from a deeper pain.

73
00:06:16,643 --> 00:06:19,510
Freeing you
to do what all Kree must...

74
00:06:20,513 --> 00:06:22,845
put your people's needs
before your own.

75
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:25,379
We've given you a great gift.

76
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:28,078
The chance to fight
for the good of all Kree.

77
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:30,682
<i>Wanna serve.</i>

78
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:32,825
Then master yourself.

79
00:06:32,993 --> 00:06:35,553
What was given
can be taken away.

80
00:06:39,933 --> 00:06:40,991
I won't let you down.

81
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:43,192
We'll know soon enough.

82
00:06:43,837 --> 00:06:45,271
You have a mission.

83
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:49,107
Serve well, and with honor.

84
00:07:10,063 --> 00:07:11,462
This can't be good.

85
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:13,463
Must be another Skrull attack.

86
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,099
Whatever it is, it's big.

87
00:07:16,136 --> 00:07:17,365
Has a Skrull ever simmed you?

88
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:18,561
Once.

89
00:07:18,738 --> 00:07:20,900
- It was deeply disturbing.
- Why?

90
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:23,266
Because I stared into
the face of my mortal enemy...

91
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,309
and the face staring back
was my own.

92
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:26,906
Maybe if you were
more attractive,

93
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,379
then it would be
less disturbing.

94
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:30,482
You think you're funny,
but I'm not laughing.

95
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:31,776
You never laugh.

96
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:34,444
I laugh on the inside.

97
00:07:35,055 --> 00:07:36,113
I'm not doing that now.

98
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:37,415
It's funny 'cause,
objectively speaking,

99
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:38,582
you're quite handsome.

100
00:07:38,758 --> 00:07:39,816
Well, thank you.

101
00:07:39,993 --> 00:07:42,087
Listen up, team.
Knock it off.

102
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:43,553
All right.

103
00:07:44,264 --> 00:07:46,392
Prepare for...

104
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,097
a search and rescue
of our spy, Soh-Larr.

105
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:53,466
The Skrulls have invaded
yet another border planet.

106
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,438
<i>This time, Torfa.</i>

107
00:07:55,608 --> 00:07:56,598
Soh-Larr sent us a warning.

108
00:07:56,776 --> 00:08:00,110
The signal was intercepted,
and his cover's blown.

109
00:08:01,915 --> 00:08:03,474
The Skrull general, Talos,

110
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,244
has sent kill units to find him.

111
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:06,943
Should they reach him
before we do...

112
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,281
the intelligence he's acquired

113
00:08:08,355 --> 00:08:10,084
over three years
is as good as theirs.

114
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:12,926
The Accusers will bomb

115
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:14,961
a Skrull stronghold
here in the south.

116
00:08:15,128 --> 00:08:17,859
We slip in,
we locate Soh-Larr...

117
00:08:18,465 --> 00:08:21,457
and we get out,
leaving them none the wiser.

118
00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:23,193
The Tor-fan populace.

119
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:25,267
We are not to interfere
with them,

120
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:26,362
nor them with us.

121
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:29,839
Nothing compromises
the security of our mission.

122
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,671
Proceed with caution.

123
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:34,208
Follow protocol
before extracting him.

124
00:08:35,882 --> 00:08:37,372
This is a dangerous mission.

125
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:40,383
We must all be ready
to join the Collective

126
00:08:40,487 --> 00:08:41,886
if that is our fate today.

127
00:08:42,055 --> 00:08:43,045
For the good of all Kree.

128
00:08:43,223 --> 00:08:44,213
For the good of all Kree!

129
00:09:54,461 --> 00:09:56,953
Vers, track Soh-Larr's beacon.

130
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:59,758
Art-Lass, Minn-Erva,
find elevation.

131
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,116
Locals on the periphery.

132
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:22,216
Maybe a dozen.

133
00:10:22,489 --> 00:10:23,786
Minn-Erva?

134
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:28,086
Do you read me?
Does anybody copy?

135
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:29,985
Repeat.

136
00:10:43,776 --> 00:10:45,608
His bee-man's coming from
that temple. Let's move.

137
00:10:46,246 --> 00:10:48,578
No. This is a perfect spot
for an ambush'

138
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:49,840
Only one way in,
only one way out.

139
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:51,506
We can get past the locals.

140
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:54,278
We don't know
if they are locals. Too risky.

141
00:10:54,454 --> 00:10:55,512
You don't have to go with me.
I'll go alone.

142
00:10:55,688 --> 00:10:56,678
No, you won't.

143
00:11:01,694 --> 00:11:03,685
Right. We keep a close radius.

144
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:05,922
We lose comms,
we meet back at the Helion.

145
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,195
Come on.

146
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:21,811
Art-Lass, you getting this?

147
00:11:21,981 --> 00:11:23,346
Copy. I see them.

148
00:11:33,493 --> 00:11:34,551
Get back!

149
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,285
Commander'?

150
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:46,134
Get back! Back!

151
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:49,503
Minn-Erva?
Do you have eyes on this?

152
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:52,168
Keep them back.
Minn-Erva?

153
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:54,541
Does anybody copy?

154
00:11:58,685 --> 00:12:00,016
I don't wanna hurt you.

155
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:03,814
Keep back!

156
00:12:07,327 --> 00:12:08,317
Stay back!

157
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:14,865
They're locals.
I found two dead. No green.

158
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:16,661
They're just starving.

159
00:12:42,228 --> 00:12:43,718
HGX-78.

160
00:12:43,896 --> 00:12:46,627
<i>TRT79-WX6.</i>

161
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:51,135
Get back.

162
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:00,435
Skrulls!

163
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:19,121
VETS!

164
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:21,393
Vers? Skrulls.

165
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:23,399
<i>It's an ambush.</i>

166
00:13:42,355 --> 00:13:43,413
Incoming!

167
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,026
<i>Back to me Helion.</i>

168
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:51,591
Vers. Do you copy?

169
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:54,164
<i>Back to the Helion.</i>

170
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:55,460
<i>Come in. Vers.</i>

171
00:13:55,635 --> 00:13:57,296
How did you know the code?

172
00:13:58,037 --> 00:14:00,335
How about
I tell you my secret...

173
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:04,375
when you've told me yours?

174
00:14:08,114 --> 00:14:09,445
<i>Let's open her up.</i>

175
00:14:21,661 --> 00:14:23,823
Where are we?

176
00:14:23,996 --> 00:14:25,395
Stand by.

177
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:28,394
Where's your head at?

178
00:14:29,469 --> 00:14:31,631
In the clouds. Where's yours?

179
00:14:31,838 --> 00:14:33,363
On my shoulders.

180
00:14:33,473 --> 00:14:35,066
About to show these boys
how we do it.

181
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:36,640
You ready?

182
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:37,699
Higher, further, faster, baby.

183
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:38,800
That's right.

184
00:14:48,755 --> 00:14:50,189
<i>This can't be right.</i>

185
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:53,417
<i>Go back even further.</i>

186
00:14:57,330 --> 00:15:00,095
You're going too fast!
You need to go slow!

187
00:15:13,713 --> 00:15:16,182
<i>Who is this person?
Are we in the right...?</i>

188
00:15:16,282 --> 00:15:17,374
What the hell are you thinking?

189
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:18,440
You don't belong out here!

190
00:15:18,684 --> 00:15:19,947
<i>I think we went back too far.</i>

191
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:21,450
You let him drive.

192
00:15:21,621 --> 00:15:23,020
<i>Let me try something.</i>

193
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:26,586
Give up already!

194
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,386
You don't belong out here!

195
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:32,891
You're not strong enough.

196
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:34,396
You'll kill yourself.

197
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:41,764
They'll never let you fly.

198
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:44,273
<i>Am I the only one
that's confused here?</i>

199
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:46,572
You're a decent pilot.

200
00:15:46,746 --> 00:15:47,736
But you're too emotional.

201
00:15:47,914 --> 00:15:50,611
You do know why they call it
a cockpit, don't you?

202
00:15:58,157 --> 00:16:01,320
A huge rumble throughout
the cosmos shook the moon...

203
00:16:01,494 --> 00:16:04,464
and the sun and the stars
in the sky.

204
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:05,654
And so,

205
00:16:05,765 --> 00:16:07,494
little Alouette flew up
throughout the night.

206
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:10,398
Did you see her?
It's Alouette.

207
00:16:11,838 --> 00:16:13,932
Get your butts inside,
it's time to eat.

208
00:16:14,106 --> 00:16:16,268
Prepare for takeoff,
Lieutenant Trouble.

209
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:17,568
<i>Charming memory.</i>

210
00:16:17,743 --> 00:16:18,733
<i>Hang on.</i>

211
00:16:18,911 --> 00:16:20,276
<i>1 think I've got it.</i>

212
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,418
Goose likes you.

213
00:16:26,586 --> 00:16:27,951
She doesn't typically
take to people.

214
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,451
Early start to your morning.

215
00:16:29,622 --> 00:16:30,748
Uh, late night, actually.

216
00:16:30,923 --> 00:16:32,823
I can't sleep
when there's work to do.

217
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:33,982
Sound familiar'?

218
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,650
Flying your planes
never feels like work.

219
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:38,623
Wonderful view, isn't it'?

220
00:16:38,798 --> 00:16:40,630
I prefer the view from up there.

221
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:41,959
You'll get there
soon enough, Ace.

222
00:16:42,134 --> 00:16:44,193
<i>Wait! Wait, wait!
That's her. Get her back.</i>

223
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:45,997
Stand by.

224
00:16:49,642 --> 00:16:50,837
Sound familiar'?

225
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:52,511
Wonderful view, isn't it?

226
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,373
I prefer the view from up there.

227
00:16:56,549 --> 00:16:57,675
You'll get there
soon enough, Ace.

228
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:58,874
<i>What's that on her shirt?</i>

229
00:16:58,985 --> 00:17:00,214
<i>I couldn't read it.</i>

230
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:03,619
Wonderful view, isn't it'?

231
00:17:06,292 --> 00:17:07,953
I prefer the view from up there.

232
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:10,860
- Focus.
- Excuse me?

233
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,691
<i>Look down.</i>

234
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,731
<i>Focus.</i>

235
00:17:14,901 --> 00:17:17,563
<i>"Pegasus. Dr. Wendy Lawson."
That's her.</i>

236
00:17:17,737 --> 00:17:18,727
Do you hear that, too?

237
00:17:18,905 --> 00:17:20,236
<i>Do we have her location?</i>

238
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:23,365
<i>Got it.</i>

239
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:26,335
<i>Now track Lawson until
we find the energy signature.</i>

240
00:17:30,683 --> 00:17:32,242
<i>Interesting.</i>

241
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:35,844
<i>Huh. Hold on.</i>

242
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:39,154
<i>Go back right before this.
Go back.</i>

243
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,421
That's no MiG, Lawson.

244
00:17:42,595 --> 00:17:44,927
<i>This is it. Now let me
see where you're headed.</i>

245
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:47,594
<i>That's right.
Look at the coordinates.</i>

246
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:49,701
<i>Focus.</i>

247
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:52,871
<i>Open, please.</i>

248
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:54,536
<i>That's it. That's it.</i>

249
00:17:54,707 --> 00:17:55,902
<i>You're almost there.</i>

250
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:57,601
<i>You're almost there.
Don't fight it.</i>

251
00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:00,541
<i>Focus!</i>

252
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:03,906
<i>Get her back!
Get her back now!</i>

253
00:18:08,688 --> 00:18:09,917
This doesn't make any sense.

254
00:18:25,071 --> 00:18:28,473
Do we have any information
we can act on?

255
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:31,869
Just that Lawson was somewhere
on planet 0-53.

256
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:33,034
We're on our way.

257
00:18:33,212 --> 00:18:34,941
Then dig, dig, dig deeper.

258
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:39,245
Lawson is our link
to that light-speed engine!

259
00:18:40,553 --> 00:18:41,884
And everything we're after.

260
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:50,585
Oh!

261
00:18:51,564 --> 00:18:52,759
That did something.

262
00:18:52,932 --> 00:18:54,229
Try that again.

263
00:19:05,845 --> 00:19:06,835
Not yet!

264
00:19:16,422 --> 00:19:17,787
What did you do to me?

265
00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:20,322
Now we're just after
a little information.

266
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:21,961
What did you put in my head?

267
00:19:22,128 --> 00:19:23,994
Nothing that wasn't
already there.

268
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:26,962
But those aren't my memories.

269
00:19:27,133 --> 00:19:29,625
Yeah, it's like a bad trip,
isn't it?

270
00:19:29,802 --> 00:19:31,998
I'm not surprised
you can't keep it straight.

271
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,265
They really did a number on you.

272
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,464
Enough of your mind games.

273
00:19:35,641 --> 00:19:37,131
What do you want?

274
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:41,680
We're looking for the location
of a Dr. Lawson...

275
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:43,372
and her light-speed engine.

276
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:45,210
I don't know any Dr. Lawson.

277
00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:48,945
Really?
Then why is she in your head?

278
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:20,977
You guys wouldn't happen to know

279
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,043
how these things come off,
would ya?

280
00:20:22,688 --> 00:20:23,678
No?

281
00:20:23,856 --> 00:20:25,085
Fine.

282
00:20:47,947 --> 00:20:48,937
Hmm.

283
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:57,906
Hey.

284
00:22:03,189 --> 00:22:04,486
You do
know why they call it a...

285
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:23,805
You leaving so soon?

286
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:26,209
We're just getting to know
each other.

287
00:23:49,695 --> 00:23:52,687
Vers to Starforce command,
do you read me?

288
00:23:55,034 --> 00:23:57,526
Hello? Do you copy?

289
00:24:27,066 --> 00:24:28,898
Hi. I'm Vers. Kree Starforce.

290
00:24:29,068 --> 00:24:30,229
Is this C-53?

291
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:35,331
Do you understand me? Ls my
universal translator working?

292
00:24:35,507 --> 00:24:37,498
Yeah. I understand you.

293
00:24:37,843 --> 00:24:39,004
Oh, good.

294
00:24:39,178 --> 00:24:40,976
Are you in charge of security
for this district?

295
00:24:42,748 --> 00:24:45,581
Sort of. Uh, the movie theater
has its own guy.

296
00:24:47,019 --> 00:24:48,919
Where can I find
communications equipment?

297
00:24:56,028 --> 00:24:57,154
Thank you.

298
00:25:30,162 --> 00:25:32,187
Track the pod. Find the girl.

299
00:25:33,232 --> 00:25:35,724
She knows more than she knows.

300
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:39,162
Hey.

301
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:41,806
This one's taken.

302
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,579
Come on.

303
00:25:54,153 --> 00:25:55,177
Vers?

304
00:25:55,354 --> 00:25:56,412
<i>Vers?</i>

305
00:25:57,256 --> 00:25:59,088
Verify. CTC-39.

306
00:25:59,258 --> 00:26:00,419
<i>GRXV-1600.</i>

307
00:26:00,592 --> 00:26:01,821
<i>And I'm fine,
thank you for asking.</i>

308
00:26:02,928 --> 00:26:04,327
<i>Is everyone okay?
What happened?</i>

309
00:26:04,496 --> 00:26:06,260
Skrull ambush.

310
00:26:06,432 --> 00:26:07,991
I thought we'd lost you.

311
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,190
<i>Did you find Soh-Larr?</i>

312
00:26:09,368 --> 00:26:10,563
<i>It wasn't Soh-Larr.</i>

313
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:12,670
<i>Talos simmed him.
Even knew his code.</i>

314
00:26:12,838 --> 00:26:14,932
That's impossible.

315
00:26:15,107 --> 00:26:16,939
That code was buried
in his unconscious.

316
00:26:17,109 --> 00:26:18,406
The Skrulls messed with my mind.

317
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:19,567
The machine that they used...

318
00:26:19,745 --> 00:26:21,611
I think it's how they
extracted Soh-Larr's code.

319
00:26:22,214 --> 00:26:23,204
Vers, where are you?

320
00:26:23,382 --> 00:26:24,850
I'm on planet C-53.

321
00:26:25,617 --> 00:26:27,949
The Skrulls are looking for
someone named Lawson.

322
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,451
<i>Who?</i>

323
00:26:29,621 --> 00:26:32,750
She's who I see.

324
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:34,552
<i>She's what?</i>

325
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,557
<i>Vers?</i>

326
00:26:37,629 --> 00:26:38,619
<i>Vers, what?</i>

327
00:26:40,065 --> 00:26:41,260
She's a scientist.

328
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:43,265
They think that she's cracked
the code on light-speed tech.

329
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:45,028
I have to get to her
before they do...

330
00:26:45,204 --> 00:26:46,638
<i>or else they'll be able
to invade new galaxies.</i>

331
00:26:46,805 --> 00:26:48,569
No. You've been
caught once already.

332
00:26:49,808 --> 00:26:51,298
How far is C-53?

333
00:26:52,044 --> 00:26:54,479
Closest jump point is 22 hours.

334
00:26:54,646 --> 00:26:56,637
<i>Vers, hold your
position until we get there.</i>

335
00:26:56,815 --> 00:26:58,749
<i>Keep your comms online
so we can contact you.</i>

336
00:26:58,917 --> 00:27:00,783
No! What if they get
a hold of it before...

337
00:27:00,886 --> 00:27:01,910
W979 sorry.

338
00:27:01,987 --> 00:27:03,045
<i>A long-distance
company access code</i>

339
00:27:03,122 --> 00:27:04,112
<i>is required for me number
you have dialed.</i>

340
00:27:04,223 --> 00:27:05,816
<i>- Yon-Rogg?
- Vers?</i>

341
00:27:07,259 --> 00:27:08,249
<i>Vets'?</i>

342
00:27:08,427 --> 00:27:09,724
<i>Please dial your can
with the access code.</i>

343
00:27:09,895 --> 00:27:10,885
<i>Vers?</i>

344
00:27:11,997 --> 00:27:14,625
If the Skrulls got
to her, she's compromised.

345
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,791
She's stronger than you think.

346
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:19,604
Ever been to C-53?

347
00:27:20,272 --> 00:27:21,330
Once.

348
00:27:22,141 --> 00:27:24,235
It's a real shithole.

349
00:27:34,753 --> 00:27:37,620
Hey, rookie!
Go talk to the rent-a-cop.

350
00:27:44,696 --> 00:27:46,255
Did you call this in?

351
00:28:00,946 --> 00:28:01,936
Beacon activated.

352
00:28:05,384 --> 00:28:06,715
Excuse me, miss.

353
00:28:06,885 --> 00:28:09,286
You know anything
about a lady blowing a hole...

354
00:28:09,454 --> 00:28:12,617
through the roof of that
Blockbuster over there?

355
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:15,385
Witness says
she was dressed for laser tag.

356
00:28:16,795 --> 00:28:17,887
Oh.

357
00:28:18,297 --> 00:28:20,231
Yeah, I think she went that way.

358
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:23,961
Uh, I'd like to ask you
some questions.

359
00:28:24,303 --> 00:28:28,137
Maybe give you the 411
on the late-night drop box.

360
00:28:28,674 --> 00:28:30,301
Could I see
some identification, please?

361
00:28:30,676 --> 00:28:32,201
<i>Vers. Kree Starforce.</i>

362
00:28:32,311 --> 00:28:33,335
We don't carry
our identification

363
00:28:33,412 --> 00:28:34,402
on little cards.

364
00:28:34,513 --> 00:28:35,503
<i>Vers?</i>

365
00:28:36,348 --> 00:28:38,146
<i>Starforce?</i>

366
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:40,916
How long you plan to be in town?

367
00:28:41,086 --> 00:28:42,144
Oh, I'll be out of your hair...

368
00:28:42,321 --> 00:28:43,550
as soon as I track down
the Skrulls

369
00:28:43,655 --> 00:28:45,350
that are infiltrating
your planet.

370
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:47,552
Skrulls?

371
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,152
Shapeshifters?

372
00:28:49,328 --> 00:28:52,354
They can transform into any
life-form down to the DNA.

373
00:28:53,832 --> 00:28:55,425
Oh, boy. You guys don't have
any clue, do you'?

374
00:28:55,934 --> 00:28:57,834
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on.

375
00:28:58,837 --> 00:29:04,105
How do we know you're not
one of those shapeshifters?

376
00:29:04,276 --> 00:29:06,074
Congratulations, Agent Fury.

377
00:29:06,245 --> 00:29:08,179
You have finally asked
a relevant question.

378
00:29:08,347 --> 00:29:11,282
No! Congratulations to you,
Star-force lady.

379
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:13,544
You're under arrest.

380
00:29:21,393 --> 00:29:22,588
Rook!

381
00:29:23,462 --> 00:29:24,725
Rook, let's roll!

382
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:35,565
Did you see her weapon?

383
00:29:35,741 --> 00:29:37,766
I did not.

384
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:47,911
Watch ii!

385
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:22,954
Suspect on northbound train.
In pursuit.

386
00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:46,774
"Trust me,
true believer." "Trust me."

387
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:53,947
"Trust me, true believer."

388
00:31:40,065 --> 00:31:41,055
Get off!

389
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:38,552
Train's heading
for a tunnel up ahead.

390
00:32:41,593 --> 00:32:43,561
Let's greet them at the station.

391
00:32:55,106 --> 00:32:57,097
Mr. Fury,
this is Agent Coulson.

392
00:32:58,243 --> 00:33:00,143
Uh, I'm still here
at the Blockbuster.

393
00:33:02,347 --> 00:33:03,473
And, uh, where'd everybody go?

394
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:05,973
<i>I finished
collecting evidence...</i>

395
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:35,502
We need an ambulance!

396
00:34:35,674 --> 00:34:36,835
Someone call 911!

397
00:34:37,008 --> 00:34:38,498
Hey! You all right?

398
00:34:38,677 --> 00:34:40,509
Oh, my gosh! Is everyone okay?

399
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:41,669
Anyone else see that?

400
00:34:41,846 --> 00:34:44,747
Official S.H.I.E.L.D.
activity. Stay back.

401
00:35:33,465 --> 00:35:35,126
Nice scuba suit.

402
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:42,471
Lighten up, honey, huh?

403
00:35:42,641 --> 00:35:44,473
Got a smile for me?

404
00:35:48,747 --> 00:35:49,908
Freak.

405
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:12,668
All life on Earth
is carbon-based. Not this guy.

406
00:36:13,104 --> 00:36:15,471
Whatever he runs on,

407
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:16,837
it's not on the periodic table.

408
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:19,602
You're saying
he's not from around here?

409
00:36:20,612 --> 00:36:21,670
Hey, how's your eye?

410
00:36:22,681 --> 00:36:24,843
Well, I'd say fine...

411
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:27,451
but it can't believe
what it's seeing.

412
00:36:30,055 --> 00:36:35,118
You say this thing
looked like Coulson?

413
00:36:35,226 --> 00:36:37,126
Mmm. Talked like him, too.

414
00:36:37,295 --> 00:36:39,992
And the woman said
that there were more?

415
00:36:40,165 --> 00:36:42,065
The word she used
was "infiltration."

416
00:36:42,233 --> 00:36:43,291
You believe her?

417
00:36:43,468 --> 00:36:44,993
Not till I saw this.

418
00:36:45,837 --> 00:36:48,306
What's your plan?

419
00:36:48,907 --> 00:36:50,705
I'll find Blockbuster girl.

420
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:53,037
I got word on a motorcycle thief

421
00:36:53,144 --> 00:36:54,475
that fits her description.

422
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:57,344
If she can tell us
why these lizards are here...

423
00:36:57,982 --> 00:37:00,076
maybe she can tell us
how to kick 'em to the curb.

424
00:37:00,251 --> 00:37:01,241
Good.

425
00:37:02,587 --> 00:37:05,056
Do it alone, though.
We can't trust anyone.

426
00:37:06,191 --> 00:37:08,182
Not even our own men.

427
00:37:08,359 --> 00:37:09,588
YES, sir.

428
00:37:24,042 --> 00:37:26,841
Wow. They're ugly bastards,
aren't they?

429
00:37:27,178 --> 00:37:30,773
Yeah,
well, he's no Brad Pitt, sir.

430
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:38,089
Safe journey to the beyond,
my friend.

431
00:37:40,024 --> 00:37:42,925
I will finish what we started.

432
00:37:51,536 --> 00:37:53,527
I wouldn't get
too close there, boss.

433
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:57,235
No one in or out.

434
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:34,069
Boom!

435
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:00,462
What can I get ya?

436
00:39:00,939 --> 00:39:02,373
Where was this photograph taken?

437
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:04,433
An airport.

438
00:39:04,609 --> 00:39:05,838
Where's Pegasus?

439
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,603
That's classified.

440
00:39:08,112 --> 00:39:11,309
Not unlike the file
I started on you.

441
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:15,513
But I see you've changed it up
a bit since then.

442
00:39:15,687 --> 00:39:17,314
Grunge is a good look for you.

443
00:39:17,488 --> 00:39:18,978
Did you have a rough day,
Agent Fury?

444
00:39:19,157 --> 00:39:20,625
It was cool, you know?

445
00:39:20,792 --> 00:39:23,557
Had a space invasion,
big car chase.

446
00:39:23,728 --> 00:39:27,187
Got to watch an alien autopsy.

447
00:39:27,799 --> 00:39:29,233
Typical nine-to-five.

448
00:39:29,467 --> 00:39:30,457
So you saw one?

449
00:39:30,568 --> 00:39:33,333
I was never one
to believe in aliens...

450
00:39:34,305 --> 00:39:36,239
but I can't unsee that.

451
00:39:36,574 --> 00:39:39,043
This is gonna get a little
awkward, but I got to ask.

452
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:41,508
You think I'm one of those
green things.

453
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:42,976
Can't be too careful.

454
00:39:43,147 --> 00:39:47,880
You are looking at
100% red-blooded Earth man.

455
00:39:48,086 --> 00:39:49,349
I'm afraid I'm gonna need proof.

456
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,488
We talking cheek swab
or urine sample?

457
00:39:51,656 --> 00:39:53,351
No. The DNA would match.

458
00:39:53,558 --> 00:39:54,582
Want my AOL password?

459
00:39:54,826 --> 00:39:56,760
Skrulls can only sim
recent memories

460
00:39:56,861 --> 00:39:58,852
- of their host bodies.
- Oh, oh.

461
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:01,554
You wanna get personal.

462
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,695
- Where were you born?
- Huntsville, Alabama.

463
00:40:03,868 --> 00:40:05,233
But technically,
I don't remember that part.

464
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:06,837
- Name of your first pet?
- Mr. Snoofers.

465
00:40:07,005 --> 00:40:08,268
- Mr. Snoofers?
- That's what I said.

466
00:40:08,373 --> 00:40:09,363
Do I pass?

467
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,771
Not yet. First job?

468
00:40:10,942 --> 00:40:12,706
Soldier.
Straight out of high school.

469
00:40:12,777 --> 00:40:13,938
Left the ranks
a full bird colonel.

470
00:40:14,112 --> 00:40:15,170
- Then?
- Spy.

471
00:40:15,346 --> 00:40:16,404
- Where?
- It was the Cold War.

472
00:40:16,514 --> 00:40:17,606
We were everywhere.

473
00:40:17,782 --> 00:40:20,444
Uh, Belfast. Bucharest.
Belgrade. Budapest.

474
00:40:20,618 --> 00:40:22,108
I like the B's.
I can make them rhyme.

475
00:40:22,287 --> 00:40:23,413
- Now?
- Been riding a desk

476
00:40:23,521 --> 00:40:24,511
for the past six years...

477
00:40:24,622 --> 00:40:25,680
trying to figure out where our

478
00:40:25,757 --> 00:40:26,747
future enemies are coming from.

479
00:40:26,858 --> 00:40:28,019
Never occurred to me

480
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:30,356
they would be coming from above.

481
00:40:30,528 --> 00:40:31,859
Name a detail so bizarre

482
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:33,227
a Skrull could never
fabricate it.

483
00:40:35,767 --> 00:40:39,294
If toast is cut diagonally,
I can't eat it.

484
00:40:41,239 --> 00:40:42,707
You didn't need that, did you?

485
00:40:42,874 --> 00:40:44,535
No. No, I didn't.
But I enjoyed it.

486
00:40:45,143 --> 00:40:46,770
Okay. Your turn.

487
00:40:46,945 --> 00:40:48,606
Prove you're not a Skrull.

488
00:40:57,221 --> 00:40:59,747
And how is that
supposed to prove to me

489
00:40:59,824 --> 00:41:01,053
you're not a Skrull?

490
00:41:01,225 --> 00:41:02,454
That's a photon blast.

491
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:03,921
And?

492
00:41:03,995 --> 00:41:04,985
A Skrull can't do that.

493
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:07,256
So, a full bird colonel

494
00:41:07,332 --> 00:41:08,458
turned spy
turned S.H.I.E.L.D. agent...

495
00:41:08,666 --> 00:41:11,135
must have pretty high
security clearance.

496
00:41:11,669 --> 00:41:12,761
Where's Pegasus?

497
00:41:18,443 --> 00:41:21,344
Okay.
The Skrulls sim alien races

498
00:41:21,446 --> 00:41:23,175
to infiltrate
and take over planets.

499
00:41:23,348 --> 00:41:27,410
And you're a Kree?
A race of noble warriors?

500
00:41:27,585 --> 00:41:30,077
Heroes. Noble warrior heroes.

501
00:41:30,254 --> 00:41:33,815
So, um, what do Skrulls
want with Dr. Lawson?

502
00:41:35,126 --> 00:41:36,958
They believe that she developed

503
00:41:37,028 --> 00:41:38,860
a light-speed engine at Pegasus.

504
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:40,589
Light-speed engine?

505
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:42,997
Gotta admit, that's not

506
00:41:43,101 --> 00:41:44,364
the craziest thing
I've heard today.

507
00:41:44,535 --> 00:41:46,128
Well, it's still early.

508
00:41:46,304 --> 00:41:48,204
And you, what do you want?

509
00:41:48,373 --> 00:41:50,671
To stop the Skrulls before
they become unstoppable.

510
00:41:50,775 --> 00:41:51,765
And?

511
00:41:55,947 --> 00:41:59,212
Look, war is
a universal language.

512
00:41:59,384 --> 00:42:02,115
I know a rogue soldier
when I see one.

513
00:42:02,286 --> 00:42:04,516
You got a personal stake
in this.

514
00:42:14,665 --> 00:42:16,326
This <i>is</i> government property.

515
00:42:16,401 --> 00:42:18,233
<i>Turn your vehicle around.</i>

516
00:42:18,403 --> 00:42:21,464
Nicholas Joseph Fury.
Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.

517
00:42:21,639 --> 00:42:23,801
<i>Place your thumb on the pad.</i>

518
00:42:24,909 --> 00:42:26,138
<i>One moment.</i>

519
00:42:26,711 --> 00:42:30,238
Nicholas Joseph Fury.
You have three names?

520
00:42:30,882 --> 00:42:32,372
Everybody calls me Fury.

521
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:36,418
Not Nicholas. Not Joseph.
Not Nick. Just Fury.

522
00:42:36,587 --> 00:42:38,021
- What does your mom call you?
- Fury.

523
00:42:38,189 --> 00:42:39,679
- What do you call her'?
- Fury.

524
00:42:39,857 --> 00:42:40,881
What about your kids?

525
00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:42,823
If I have them,
they'll call me Fury.

526
00:42:42,994 --> 00:42:44,189
<i>You are cleared for access.</i>

527
00:42:44,262 --> 00:42:45,252
Thank you.

528
00:43:15,293 --> 00:43:16,522
Oh, hold up.

529
00:43:17,061 --> 00:43:19,723
You look like
somebody's disaffected niece.

530
00:43:21,732 --> 00:43:22,722
Put that on.

531
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:26,134
- What is it?
- It's the S.H.I.E.L.D. logo.

532
00:43:26,304 --> 00:43:28,966
Does, uh, announcing
your identity on clothing

533
00:43:29,073 --> 00:43:30,563
help with
the covert pan of your job?

534
00:43:30,741 --> 00:43:32,971
Said the space soldier
who was wearing a rubber suit.

535
00:43:34,078 --> 00:43:35,239
Lose the flannel.

536
00:43:46,324 --> 00:43:47,655
How can I help you?

537
00:43:48,392 --> 00:43:50,383
We're agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.

538
00:43:52,797 --> 00:43:54,765
We're looking for a woman
named Lawson.

539
00:43:54,932 --> 00:43:57,162
A Dr. Wendy Lawson.

540
00:43:58,736 --> 00:44:00,226
Do you know her?

541
00:44:04,509 --> 00:44:05,772
Follow me.

542
00:44:06,444 --> 00:44:07,434
<i>Hmm.</i>

543
00:44:10,148 --> 00:44:13,413
You familiar with the phrase
"welcome wagon"?

544
00:44:14,418 --> 00:44:15,408
No.

545
00:44:16,687 --> 00:44:18,985
Well, this ain't it.

546
00:44:26,297 --> 00:44:27,355
Is that a communicator?

547
00:44:27,532 --> 00:44:30,832
Yeah. State-of-the-an
two-way pager.

548
00:44:31,002 --> 00:44:32,094
Who are you paging?

549
00:44:32,270 --> 00:44:35,934
My mom. Don't worry.
I didn't mention you.

550
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:15,535
After you.

551
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:17,340
Impressive.

552
00:45:17,515 --> 00:45:20,212
Oh, you should see what I can
do with a paperclip.

553
00:45:30,861 --> 00:45:33,193
Hey, there. How are you?

554
00:45:35,032 --> 00:45:37,831
Oh, my goodness. Look at you.
Just look at you.

555
00:45:38,035 --> 00:45:40,402
Aren't you
the cutest little thing?

556
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:42,767
Aren't you cute?
And what's your name, huh?

557
00:45:42,873 --> 00:45:43,863
What's your name?

558
00:45:44,041 --> 00:45:46,840
"Goose."
Cool name for a cool cat.

559
00:45:46,911 --> 00:45:47,901
Fury?

560
00:45:48,246 --> 00:45:49,236
Hmm?

561
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:52,712
I'll be back.

562
00:45:56,053 --> 00:45:58,181
Oh! Let me get
my fingerprint out.

563
00:45:58,389 --> 00:45:59,857
Just let me unravel this puppy.

564
00:46:04,128 --> 00:46:06,426
You sat there and watched me
play with tape?

565
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:07,587
When all you had to do was...

566
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:09,255
I didn't wanna steal
your thunder.

567
00:46:26,384 --> 00:46:28,443
Huh. Lawson.

568
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:41,625
Lawson's plan
for the light-speed engine.

569
00:46:42,967 --> 00:46:44,435
I wonder why
they terminated the project.

570
00:46:45,169 --> 00:46:49,572
Um, maybe because she's cuckoo.

571
00:46:52,143 --> 00:46:53,304
Kree glyphs?

572
00:46:53,778 --> 00:46:54,836
Hmm?

573
00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:57,807
Lawson is not cuckoo.

574
00:47:00,151 --> 00:47:01,778
She's Kree.

575
00:47:01,952 --> 00:47:04,353
Well, she's dead.

576
00:47:04,588 --> 00:47:05,987
What?

577
00:47:06,157 --> 00:47:07,818
<i>She crashed the Asis aircraft</i>

578
00:47:07,925 --> 00:47:09,791
doing an unauthorized
test flight.

579
00:47:09,994 --> 00:47:11,962
Took a pilot down with her.

580
00:47:12,129 --> 00:47:14,291
That's why security here
is so unfriendly.

581
00:47:14,465 --> 00:47:17,491
They're covering up
a billion-dollar mistake.

582
00:47:19,103 --> 00:47:21,800
Oh, and your light-speed
engine is toast.

583
00:47:25,343 --> 00:47:26,833
When did this crash happen?

584
00:47:27,645 --> 00:47:30,671
Six years ago. 1989.

585
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:33,283
Who was the pilot?

586
00:47:34,118 --> 00:47:37,281
Um, most of
this thing's redacted...

587
00:47:37,455 --> 00:47:41,551
but there is a testimonial
here from a Maria Rambeau.

588
00:47:41,792 --> 00:47:43,817
Last person to see them alive.

589
00:47:49,166 --> 00:47:50,327
You okay?

590
00:47:52,136 --> 00:47:53,297
Mm-hmm.

591
00:47:54,872 --> 00:47:56,169
Back in a minute.

592
00:48:26,237 --> 00:48:28,103
This isn't about fighting wars.

593
00:48:28,539 --> 00:48:30,029
It's about ending them.

594
00:48:36,113 --> 00:48:37,581
<i>I know Lawson was Kree.</i>

595
00:48:37,782 --> 00:48:40,683
She was here on C-53
and died in a plane crash.

596
00:48:40,885 --> 00:48:43,513
<i>Do you know anything about this?</i>

597
00:48:43,687 --> 00:48:45,246
I just discovered
a mission report

598
00:48:45,356 --> 00:48:46,949
sent from C-53.

599
00:48:47,124 --> 00:48:48,182
There's only so much

600
00:48:48,259 --> 00:48:50,887
I'm cleared to tell you,
Vers, but...

601
00:48:54,632 --> 00:48:58,728
<i>Lawson was an undercover
Kree operative named Mar-Vell.</i>

602
00:48:58,903 --> 00:49:02,464
She was working
on a unique energy core.

603
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:03,937
Experimenting with tech

604
00:49:04,041 --> 00:49:06,874
that apparently could help us
win the war.

605
00:49:13,717 --> 00:49:14,878
She still here?

606
00:49:15,052 --> 00:49:17,487
She's cooperating
with the investigation' sir.

607
00:49:17,655 --> 00:49:19,623
- You men stay here.
- Yes, sir.

608
00:49:19,723 --> 00:49:21,657
I want to question her alone.

609
00:49:23,327 --> 00:49:25,625
Excellent work, Nicholas.

610
00:49:29,333 --> 00:49:31,165
Does it say anything about me?

611
00:49:31,335 --> 00:49:32,996
Anything about you?
No, of course not.

612
00:49:33,170 --> 00:49:34,160
<i>Why would it'!?</i>

613
00:49:34,338 --> 00:49:37,467
I found evidence
that I had a life here.

614
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:39,268
<i>On C-53?</i>

615
00:49:41,679 --> 00:49:43,078
Mar-Veil is who I see

616
00:49:43,147 --> 00:49:44,512
when I visit
the Supreme Intelligence.

617
00:49:44,682 --> 00:49:47,845
I knew her.
And I knew her as Lawson.

618
00:49:48,018 --> 00:49:50,282
This sounds like
Skrull simulation, Vers.

619
00:49:50,454 --> 00:49:52,252
No' it's not. Because I
remember. I was here.

620
00:49:52,423 --> 00:49:54,152
<i>Stop. Remember your training.</i>

621
00:49:54,325 --> 00:49:56,589
Know your enemy.
It would be you.

622
00:49:56,760 --> 00:50:00,094
<i>Do not let your emotions
override your judgment.</i>

623
00:50:01,532 --> 00:50:03,261
She's on sublevel six.

624
00:50:03,434 --> 00:50:04,799
I'll get off on five...

625
00:50:04,969 --> 00:50:07,097
and take the stairs in case
she makes a run for it.

626
00:50:08,172 --> 00:50:11,142
Do a pincer move
like we did in Havana.

627
00:50:11,342 --> 00:50:14,312
Right. Like we did in Havana.

628
00:50:25,122 --> 00:50:26,351
<i>We're nearing the jump point,.</i>

629
00:50:26,457 --> 00:50:28,050
<i>Leave your beacon on
so I can find you.</i>

630
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:30,990
We'll get to
the bottom of this, Vers.

631
00:50:31,161 --> 00:50:32,788
Together.

632
00:50:35,332 --> 00:50:36,663
<i>Okay.</i>

633
00:50:54,351 --> 00:50:55,841
VERS!

634
00:50:57,555 --> 00:50:58,818
VERS!

635
00:51:15,673 --> 00:51:17,266
Fury's colluding
with the target.

636
00:51:17,441 --> 00:51:18,704
Then why would he call us in?

637
00:51:18,876 --> 00:51:21,345
All I know is we take
him in, too. Dead or alive.

638
00:51:21,512 --> 00:51:22,775
Dead or alive?

639
00:51:37,628 --> 00:51:38,925
Go. Go, go!

640
00:51:51,408 --> 00:51:53,536
Was it something I said?

641
00:52:11,562 --> 00:52:12,586
Mmm-mmm.

642
00:52:32,182 --> 00:52:36,085
Now, you know, I don't really
need these to see...

643
00:52:36,687 --> 00:52:40,681
but they do
kinda complete the look.

644
00:52:41,358 --> 00:52:42,621
Don't you think?

645
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:01,167
You called them in?

646
00:53:01,345 --> 00:53:02,779
My bad.

647
00:53:17,161 --> 00:53:18,822
Coulson,
do you have eyes on them?

648
00:53:18,996 --> 00:53:20,657
They're not down here.

649
00:53:22,066 --> 00:53:23,124
Let's try up there.

650
00:53:32,376 --> 00:53:33,639
- What?
- Your communicator.

651
00:53:33,811 --> 00:53:35,540
You obviously
can't be trusted with it.

652
00:54:06,443 --> 00:54:08,070
Do you know
how to fly this thing?

653
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:09,235
Uh, we'll see.

654
00:54:09,413 --> 00:54:10,903
That's a yes or no question.

655
00:54:14,952 --> 00:54:15,942
Yes.

656
00:54:19,623 --> 00:54:21,057
That's what I'm talking about!

657
00:54:48,385 --> 00:54:49,614
We got a stowaway.

658
00:54:53,757 --> 00:54:54,815
Hang on, Goose.

659
00:55:00,063 --> 00:55:01,053
Goose.

660
00:55:04,268 --> 00:55:05,258
No, Goose.

661
00:55:06,670 --> 00:55:09,765
Who's a good kitty, huh?
Huh, Goose?

662
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:11,901
Yes, that's right.

663
00:55:12,075 --> 00:55:13,907
Who's a good kitty, Goose?

664
00:55:14,278 --> 00:55:15,575
You the good kitty,
that's right.

665
00:55:15,646 --> 00:55:16,807
See anyone you know'?

666
00:55:18,649 --> 00:55:20,083
Funny story.

667
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:23,914
I arrived on Hala near dead.
No memory.

668
00:55:24,755 --> 00:55:25,847
That was six years ago.

669
00:55:26,023 --> 00:55:28,185
So, you think you're the pilot

670
00:55:28,292 --> 00:55:29,453
that went down
with Dr. Lawson?

671
00:55:29,693 --> 00:55:32,025
I'm saying the last person
to see them alive

672
00:55:32,129 --> 00:55:33,119
could probably tell us.

673
00:55:33,297 --> 00:55:34,856
- Maria Rambeau?
- Mm-hmm.

674
00:55:35,032 --> 00:55:36,796
So, how do we get to Louisiana?

675
00:55:37,668 --> 00:55:40,262
Due east.
Hang a right at Memphis.

676
00:55:41,805 --> 00:55:43,671
That agent...

677
00:55:43,841 --> 00:55:45,775
that stopped the Skrulls
from finding us?

678
00:55:45,943 --> 00:55:47,843
Coulson. The new guy.

679
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:49,274
I guess he doesn't hate me yet.

680
00:55:49,513 --> 00:55:51,174
Yeah, well, give him time.

681
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:54,810
I guess he had a feeling,
you know?

682
00:55:55,018 --> 00:55:57,146
Went with his gut
against orders.

683
00:55:57,321 --> 00:55:58,652
That's a really
hard thing to do.

684
00:55:58,856 --> 00:56:00,722
But it's what keeps us human.

685
00:56:00,891 --> 00:56:03,223
I get in trouble for that.
A lot.

686
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:04,518
Oh, I can see that about you.

687
00:56:05,996 --> 00:56:09,830
Rescuing the guy who sold
you out to the Skrulls?

688
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,195
I'm guessing that's not

689
00:56:11,301 --> 00:56:12,860
standard
Kree operating procedure.

690
00:56:13,070 --> 00:56:15,198
Well, I won't tell your boss
if you don't tell mine.

691
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:24,470
Ronan.

692
00:56:24,648 --> 00:56:26,514
<i>The Accusers completed
their operation...</i>

693
00:56:26,683 --> 00:56:28,082
<i>but the greater mission
was a failure,</i>

694
00:56:28,185 --> 00:56:29,243
<i>thanks to your team.</i>

695
00:56:29,419 --> 00:56:30,909
It was a trap

696
00:56:31,021 --> 00:56:33,649
to lure our operative Vers
to Torfa and kidnap her.

697
00:56:33,824 --> 00:56:35,053
<i>Give us their location.</i>

698
00:56:35,158 --> 00:56:36,592
<i>We'll take care
of the terrorist threat.</i>

699
00:56:36,827 --> 00:56:39,057
By bombing them
out of the galaxy?

700
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:41,755
No, we'll handle this.

701
00:56:41,999 --> 00:56:44,024
<i>A cell of Skrulls anywhere</i>

702
00:56:44,101 --> 00:56:46,069
<i>is a threat to Kree everywhere.</i>

703
00:56:46,270 --> 00:56:47,260
<i>Where are they?</i>

704
00:56:47,371 --> 00:56:49,066
- They are...
- Lost

705
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,402
They are lost for now.

706
00:56:52,843 --> 00:56:54,242
But we will find them.

707
00:56:54,511 --> 00:56:57,947
<i>Do so, or we will.</i>

708
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:04,520
Maintain the course for C-53.

709
00:57:23,774 --> 00:57:25,970
Excuse me,
I'm looking for Maria Rambeau.

710
00:57:28,145 --> 00:57:29,442
Auntie Carol?

711
00:57:29,613 --> 00:57:31,547
Mom, it's Auntie Carol!

712
00:57:32,749 --> 00:57:35,241
I knew it!
Everyone said you were dead!

713
00:57:35,419 --> 00:57:37,478
But we knew they were lying.

714
00:57:39,623 --> 00:57:41,751
I'm not really
who you think I am.

715
00:57:50,968 --> 00:57:52,936
That is the craziest shit
I ever heard.

716
00:57:53,103 --> 00:57:56,095
Green transforming aliens?
There's no such thing.

717
00:57:56,273 --> 00:57:57,798
You are
absolutely right, young lady.

718
00:57:57,908 --> 00:57:59,398
There is no such thing.

719
00:57:59,576 --> 00:58:00,941
'Cause if there were,

720
00:58:01,011 --> 00:58:03,480
we would want to keep that
to ourselves'

721
00:58:03,647 --> 00:58:04,739
You don't believe me?

722
00:58:12,756 --> 00:58:13,951
No way!

723
00:58:14,424 --> 00:58:16,290
That's so cool!

724
00:58:16,493 --> 00:58:17,961
Oh, she can do
a lot more than make tea

725
00:58:18,028 --> 00:58:19,154
with those hands.

726
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:20,353
Like what? Show us.

727
00:58:20,464 --> 00:58:21,829
Maybe later.

728
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:24,329
I kept all your stuff.

729
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:25,662
I'll go get it.

730
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:28,263
You want to give her
a hand with that?

731
00:58:28,538 --> 00:58:29,630
Hmm?

732
00:58:44,654 --> 00:58:46,554
You don't remember anything?

733
00:58:48,025 --> 00:58:51,325
I see flashes.

734
00:58:52,496 --> 00:58:53,861
Little moments.

735
00:58:54,865 --> 00:58:56,355
But I can't tell what's real.

736
00:58:58,668 --> 00:59:01,968
If I could just piece together
what happened that morning...

737
00:59:02,506 --> 00:59:04,804
maybe it'll all make sense.

738
00:59:07,411 --> 00:59:11,143
You woke me up
banging on my door at dawn.

739
00:59:11,314 --> 00:59:12,839
Your usual move.

740
00:59:13,583 --> 00:59:16,018
Back then,
we had to get up so early.

741
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:19,012
The Air Force still wasn't
letting women fly combat...

742
00:59:19,189 --> 00:59:21,715
so testing Lawson's planes
was our only shot

743
00:59:21,825 --> 00:59:23,020
at doing something
that mattered.

744
00:59:23,193 --> 00:59:25,924
You wanted to race to base
in your old Mustang...

745
00:59:26,063 --> 00:59:27,053
and I wasn't about to argue,

746
00:59:27,164 --> 00:59:28,928
'cause I knew
my Camaro would dominate.

747
00:59:29,099 --> 00:59:31,227
But you cheated,
took a shortcut.

748
00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:32,926
Since when is
a shortcut cheating?

749
00:59:33,103 --> 00:59:34,161
Since it violates
the predetermined

750
00:59:34,237 --> 00:59:35,227
rules of engagement.

751
00:59:35,372 --> 00:59:36,567
I definitely
don't remember those.

752
00:59:36,706 --> 00:59:38,367
Hmm. Of course you don't.

753
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:48,548
When I got to the hangar,
Lawson was agitated.

754
00:59:48,718 --> 00:59:51,744
She said she had lives to save.

755
00:59:52,722 --> 00:59:54,121
She was trying
to take the Asis up herself,

756
00:59:54,224 --> 00:59:55,248
but you said that...

757
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:58,952
If there were lives at stake,
I would fly the plane.

758
00:59:59,129 --> 01:00:03,396
Yeah. Yep. Big hero moment.

759
01:00:03,967 --> 01:00:06,959
The kind of moment
we'd both been waiting for.

760
01:00:07,904 --> 01:00:11,465
The doc was always unique.
That's why we liked her.

761
01:00:11,641 --> 01:00:16,306
But now you're saying
she's from another planet.

762
01:00:18,081 --> 01:00:19,571
Know this must be hard for you.

763
01:00:19,749 --> 01:00:21,649
Oh, what?
This part right here?

764
01:00:22,452 --> 01:00:24,819
No. No. Mmm-mmm.

765
01:00:27,591 --> 01:00:31,619
Oh, what's hard
is losing my best friend...

766
01:00:32,129 --> 01:00:33,460
in a mission so secret

767
01:00:33,563 --> 01:00:35,622
they act
like it never even happened.

768
01:00:37,767 --> 01:00:41,226
Hard is knowing
you were out there somewhere

769
01:00:41,304 --> 01:00:43,170
too damn stubborn to die.

770
01:00:44,508 --> 01:00:47,273
And now you come up in here
after six years...

771
01:00:47,444 --> 01:00:49,310
with your supercharged
fire hands...

772
01:00:49,479 --> 01:00:50,844
and you expect me to call you...

773
01:00:51,615 --> 01:00:53,276
I don't even know what. Vers?

774
01:00:55,018 --> 01:00:56,986
Is that really who you are now?

775
01:00:59,356 --> 01:01:01,017
I don't know.

776
01:01:06,129 --> 01:01:07,654
Come look!

777
01:01:14,104 --> 01:01:15,663
This is me and you on Halloween.

778
01:01:15,839 --> 01:01:19,139
I'm Amelia Earhart
and you're Janis Joplin.

779
01:01:19,309 --> 01:01:20,799
Oh, this is you
when you were little.

780
01:01:20,977 --> 01:01:22,775
You didn't get along
with your parents...

781
01:01:22,946 --> 01:01:24,471
so Mom said
we became your real family.

782
01:01:24,648 --> 01:01:26,173
This is us on Christmas.

783
01:01:26,349 --> 01:01:27,510
I got my favorite
bunny slippers.

784
01:01:27,684 --> 01:01:29,277
This is another picture of you
when you were little.

785
01:01:29,452 --> 01:01:30,442
You've always wanted
to be a pilot.

786
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:31,610
And this is right after
you graduated.

787
01:01:31,788 --> 01:01:33,278
This was your dog
that you got for Christmas...

788
01:01:33,456 --> 01:01:35,117
This is a picture of everybody
from your Air Force team.

789
01:01:35,292 --> 01:01:36,453
And this is you with Mom

790
01:01:36,526 --> 01:01:37,687
right after a good day
of training.

791
01:01:37,861 --> 01:01:39,158
These were
your three favorite guys.

792
01:01:41,531 --> 01:01:42,726
Oh, wait. I forgot.

793
01:01:42,899 --> 01:01:44,333
Your jacket.

794
01:01:44,534 --> 01:01:45,865
Mom doesn't
let me wear it anymore

795
01:01:45,969 --> 01:01:47,562
after I spilled ketchup on it.

796
01:02:01,084 --> 01:02:03,212
That was all
that survived the crash.

797
01:02:04,521 --> 01:02:06,182
Or so we thought.

798
01:02:10,694 --> 01:02:12,560
Don't answer that.

799
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:14,356
It's just my neighbor.

800
01:02:14,531 --> 01:02:16,192
They can change into anyone.

801
01:02:21,538 --> 01:02:22,528
Hi there.

802
01:02:22,906 --> 01:02:23,896
What do you want?

803
01:02:25,375 --> 01:02:27,036
<i>- Uh...
- Hey, Tom.</i>

804
01:02:27,110 --> 01:02:28,600
This is my friend, Carol.

805
01:02:28,712 --> 01:02:30,077
Oh. Pleased to meet you.

806
01:02:32,182 --> 01:02:33,445
Yowzers.

807
01:02:33,550 --> 01:02:35,848
Static electricity
out here's no joke.

808
01:02:36,586 --> 01:02:39,283
I noticed that peculiar bird
you got parked by the road...

809
01:02:39,456 --> 01:02:40,446
and I was just wondering...

810
01:02:40,624 --> 01:02:41,750
if you mind
if I bring the boys over

811
01:02:41,858 --> 01:02:42,916
to get a closer look-see?

812
01:02:43,093 --> 01:02:45,357
- A closer look-see?
- Yeah.

813
01:02:45,528 --> 01:02:48,623
To see the "bird"
parked out by the road?

814
01:02:48,965 --> 01:02:49,955
<i>Mmm.</i>

815
01:02:50,066 --> 01:02:51,534
You're really working overtime

816
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:54,070
to sell this one,
aren't you, Talos?

817
01:02:55,071 --> 01:02:57,631
I'm sorry, Tom.
This really isn't a good time.

818
01:02:57,807 --> 01:02:59,241
I'll come by tomorrow, okay?

819
01:02:59,576 --> 01:03:01,442
- Uh...
- Okay.

820
01:03:03,713 --> 01:03:06,978
You know' you really should be
kinder to your neighbors.

821
01:03:07,617 --> 01:03:08,812
You never know
when you're gonna need

822
01:03:08,918 --> 01:03:10,545
to borrow some sugar.

823
01:03:13,323 --> 01:03:15,417
Now, hang on a second.

824
01:03:15,592 --> 01:03:19,051
Before you go swinging
those jazz hands around...

825
01:03:19,229 --> 01:03:22,164
making a mess
of your friend's house...

826
01:03:22,932 --> 01:03:24,229
It's a lovely home, miss.

827
01:03:24,434 --> 01:03:25,560
Oh. My God!

828
01:03:26,102 --> 01:03:27,627
What the hell?

829
01:03:31,408 --> 01:03:32,842
No one's gonna hurl the girl.

830
01:03:33,510 --> 01:03:35,911
Just don't kill me.

831
01:03:36,079 --> 01:03:37,843
That would really complicate
the situation.

832
01:03:38,014 --> 01:03:40,676
I'm about five seconds
from complicating that wall

833
01:03:40,784 --> 01:03:42,081
with some ugly-ass
Skrull brains.

834
01:03:42,252 --> 01:03:43,777
I'm sorry I simmed your boss.

835
01:03:43,953 --> 01:03:47,583
But now I stand before you
as my true self.

836
01:03:47,657 --> 01:03:48,749
Without deception.

837
01:03:48,992 --> 01:03:50,255
And who is that out there?

838
01:03:51,127 --> 01:03:53,459
Okay, that's a fair point...

839
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:55,324
but I'm sure that you understand

840
01:03:55,432 --> 01:03:57,526
I had to take some precautions.

841
01:03:57,701 --> 01:04:00,864
I saw you crush
20 of my best men

842
01:04:00,970 --> 01:04:01,994
with your hands bound.

843
01:04:02,172 --> 01:04:03,298
I just wanna talk.

844
01:04:03,473 --> 01:04:04,463
Last time we talked,

845
01:04:04,541 --> 01:04:05,667
I ended up
hanging from my ankles.

846
01:04:05,842 --> 01:04:08,311
That was before I knew
who you were.

847
01:04:08,478 --> 01:04:11,607
Before I knew what made you
different from the others.

848
01:04:12,682 --> 01:04:14,776
I have an audio recording
from Pegasus...

849
01:04:14,951 --> 01:04:17,886
of your voice from a plane crash

850
01:04:17,987 --> 01:04:19,386
six years ago...

851
01:04:19,556 --> 01:04:23,789
on a device I believe you call
a "black box."

852
01:04:24,327 --> 01:04:26,887
They told me it was destroyed
in the crash.

853
01:04:26,996 --> 01:04:28,054
How'd you get it?

854
01:04:28,231 --> 01:04:29,221
She don't understand.

855
01:04:29,466 --> 01:04:30,695
Young lady,
I have a special skill...

856
01:04:30,867 --> 01:04:32,335
that kind of allows me

857
01:04:32,402 --> 01:04:34,461
to get into places
I'm not supposed to be.

858
01:04:34,637 --> 01:04:35,661
Call me "young lady' again...

859
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:37,136
I'm gonna put my foot in a place

860
01:04:37,207 --> 01:04:38,641
it's not supposed to be.

861
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:43,042
Am I supposed to guess
where that is?

862
01:04:43,646 --> 01:04:44,807
Your ass.

863
01:04:44,981 --> 01:04:47,416
Okay, I get it. We're all
a little on edge here.

864
01:04:47,584 --> 01:04:49,484
But, look, I just need your help

865
01:04:49,552 --> 01:04:50,747
decoding some coordinates.

866
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:52,752
If you'll sit down
and you'll listen to this...

867
01:04:52,922 --> 01:04:56,085
I assure you,
it'll be worth your while.

868
01:04:58,828 --> 01:05:01,024
Cali your buddy back inside
and I'll listen.

869
01:05:01,664 --> 01:05:02,654
Deal.

870
01:05:03,867 --> 01:05:05,733
Oh, my God!
Get that thing away.

871
01:05:05,902 --> 01:05:07,233
How'd that get in here?

872
01:05:07,337 --> 01:05:08,429
Hmm?

873
01:05:09,839 --> 01:05:10,829
The cat?

874
01:05:10,940 --> 01:05:12,066
This isn't what
you're afraid of, is it?

875
01:05:12,575 --> 01:05:13,701
That's not a cat.

876
01:05:14,744 --> 01:05:16,872
- That's a Flerken.
- A Flerken?

877
01:05:16,946 --> 01:05:18,573
Mom?

878
01:05:26,089 --> 01:05:27,079
Monica.

879
01:05:27,257 --> 01:05:28,782
- Why can't I listen, too?
- Shh!

880
01:05:56,619 --> 01:05:58,053
What's happening?

881
01:05:58,221 --> 01:05:59,780
It's loading.

882
01:06:03,626 --> 01:06:04,923
Punch in the coordinates

883
01:06:04,994 --> 01:06:09,397
<i>5-2-2-9,
negative 4-7, 8.7-6-8, 0.2.</i>

884
01:06:09,566 --> 01:06:11,500
<i>Copy that.
Where are we going, Doc?</i>

885
01:06:11,668 --> 01:06:13,067
<i>My laboratory.</i>

886
01:06:13,236 --> 01:06:15,432
<i>Your laboratory?
What do you mean?</i>

887
01:06:15,605 --> 01:06:16,731
Oh, no.

888
01:06:16,906 --> 01:06:18,897
Is that...
Wait, what is that?

889
01:06:18,975 --> 01:06:20,409
<i>It's not showing up on my radar.</i>

890
01:06:20,577 --> 01:06:22,102
Go, Carol. <i>Fly!</i>

891
01:06:22,445 --> 01:06:24,675
That's no MiG, Lawson.
Who the hell are they?

892
01:06:24,848 --> 01:06:26,839
Those are the bad guys.
Fly faster now!

893
01:06:26,950 --> 01:06:27,940
Yes, ma'am.

894
01:06:34,090 --> 01:06:36,149
- What do they want?
- Me. My work.

895
01:06:36,359 --> 01:06:37,849
I never should have
brought you along.

896
01:06:43,099 --> 01:06:44,089
Here come some G's.

897
01:07:03,653 --> 01:07:05,348
They're firing backwards.
Hold on!

898
01:07:16,799 --> 01:07:18,028
Bail out! Bail out! Bail out!

899
01:07:21,971 --> 01:07:23,063
Stay with me, Lawson!

900
01:07:41,357 --> 01:07:42,688
Carol, come in. <i>Do</i> you <i>copy?</i>

901
01:07:42,859 --> 01:07:45,260
Yeah, I copy.
We hit ground.

902
01:07:45,428 --> 01:07:46,987
<i>Carol, are you okay?
Do you copy?</i>

903
01:07:47,163 --> 01:07:49,325
Yeah! I copy.

904
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:53,058
Doc?

905
01:07:54,070 --> 01:07:55,538
Your blood.

906
01:07:56,339 --> 01:07:58,000
It's blue.

907
01:07:58,207 --> 01:08:01,370
Yeah, but, uh, how's my hair?

908
01:08:02,845 --> 01:08:05,212
Help me out, will ya?

909
01:08:08,251 --> 01:08:11,277
I got to destroy it
before they get here.

910
01:08:11,454 --> 01:08:12,546
Lawson?

911
01:08:12,956 --> 01:08:16,722
You remember what I said about
our work here? What it's for?

912
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:18,955
To end wars?

913
01:08:19,128 --> 01:08:22,758
Yeah. But the wars are bigger
than you know.

914
01:08:23,967 --> 01:08:25,435
Damn it!

915
01:08:26,069 --> 01:08:28,037
My name is not Lawson.

916
01:08:28,471 --> 01:08:31,532
My real name is Mar-Vell,

917
01:08:31,608 --> 01:08:34,407
and I come
from a planet called Hala.

918
01:08:35,745 --> 01:08:37,770
I would say
that you're delusional...

919
01:08:37,981 --> 01:08:39,574
but we just got shot down
by a spaceship

920
01:08:39,649 --> 01:08:41,139
and your blood is blue.

921
01:08:42,051 --> 01:08:45,885
Listen, I spent half my life
fighting a shameful war.

922
01:08:46,055 --> 01:08:47,887
Now, skedaddle
before you give me

923
01:08:47,957 --> 01:08:49,152
any more regrets.

924
01:08:49,325 --> 01:08:51,419
Just remember
the coordinates, okay?

925
01:08:51,995 --> 01:08:53,588
You got to save 'em without me.

926
01:08:53,763 --> 01:08:54,787
Save who? How'?

927
01:08:54,964 --> 01:08:57,831
Now I got to blow this engine
before they find it.

928
01:08:58,001 --> 01:08:59,298
What are you doing?

929
01:09:19,255 --> 01:09:21,314
We have no interest
in hurting you.

930
01:09:21,691 --> 01:09:23,022
No?

931
01:09:23,192 --> 01:09:25,854
'Cause all the shooting kinda
gave me the wrong impression!

932
01:09:27,430 --> 01:09:28,864
The energy core.

933
01:09:29,699 --> 01:09:30,962
Where is it?

934
01:09:31,134 --> 01:09:32,829
Pararescue's on the way.

935
01:09:33,670 --> 01:09:35,536
You have two minutes
until you're surrounded.

936
01:09:35,872 --> 01:09:38,500
Then I see no reason
to prolong this conversation.

937
01:09:38,675 --> 01:09:39,699
No, wait!

938
01:09:46,149 --> 01:09:47,514
You mean that energy core?

939
01:09:52,055 --> 01:09:53,181
No!

940
01:10:36,833 --> 01:10:40,201
Commander'? She's still moving.
Permission to fire.

941
01:10:40,369 --> 01:10:41,359
Hold your fire.

942
01:10:51,380 --> 01:10:53,246
There's nothing left.

943
01:10:53,416 --> 01:10:55,077
The core has been destroyed.

944
01:11:04,694 --> 01:11:06,685
She absorbed its power.

945
01:11:08,931 --> 01:11:10,729
She's coming with us.

946
01:11:31,587 --> 01:11:32,952
He lied to me.

947
01:11:35,591 --> 01:11:37,559
Everything that I knew
was a lie.

948
01:11:37,727 --> 01:11:40,219
Now, you understand.

949
01:11:40,396 --> 01:11:42,888
What?
What do I understand now?

950
01:11:43,065 --> 01:11:44,931
Yon-Rogg killed Mar-Vell.

951
01:11:45,101 --> 01:11:46,227
He killed her...

952
01:11:47,103 --> 01:11:48,901
'cause she found out
that she was

953
01:11:48,971 --> 01:11:52,168
on the wrong side
of an unjust war.

954
01:11:52,275 --> 01:11:53,299
No.

955
01:11:53,910 --> 01:11:56,004
Your people are terrorists.

956
01:11:56,179 --> 01:11:57,669
They kill innocents.

957
01:11:57,847 --> 01:11:59,611
I saw the ruins on Torfa.

958
01:11:59,782 --> 01:12:03,013
Ruins that the Accusers
are responsible for.

959
01:12:03,419 --> 01:12:06,684
My people lived as refugees
on Torfa.

960
01:12:07,490 --> 01:12:10,460
Homeless, ever since
we resisted Kree rule...

961
01:12:10,626 --> 01:12:12,617
and they destroyed our planet.

962
01:12:12,795 --> 01:12:16,356
And the handful of us
that are left

963
01:12:16,465 --> 01:12:18,490
will be slaughtered next...

964
01:12:18,668 --> 01:12:22,662
unless you help me finish
what Mar-Veil started.

965
01:12:23,973 --> 01:12:25,372
The core that she found

966
01:12:25,474 --> 01:12:26,999
would have powered
a light-speed ship...

967
01:12:27,176 --> 01:12:28,974
capable of carrying us
to safety.

968
01:12:29,145 --> 01:12:33,104
A new home where
the Kree can't reach us.

969
01:12:34,617 --> 01:12:36,949
Lawson always told us
that our work at Pegasus

970
01:12:37,019 --> 01:12:38,282
wasn't to fight wars...

971
01:12:38,454 --> 01:12:39,444
but to end them.

972
01:12:40,056 --> 01:12:45,620
She wanted you to help us
find the core.

973
01:12:46,562 --> 01:12:47,654
Well, I already destroyed it.

974
01:12:47,830 --> 01:12:49,355
No, you destroyed the engine.

975
01:12:49,532 --> 01:12:52,524
The core that powered it
is in a remote location.

976
01:12:52,702 --> 01:12:57,003
If you help us
decode those coordinates...

977
01:12:57,173 --> 01:12:58,698
we can find it.

978
01:13:00,509 --> 01:13:02,136
You'll use it to destroy us.

979
01:13:04,413 --> 01:13:07,383
We just want a home.

980
01:13:11,654 --> 01:13:16,854
You and I lost everything
at the hands of the Kree.

981
01:13:17,026 --> 01:13:18,858
Can't you see it now'?

982
01:13:19,028 --> 01:13:20,393
You're not one of them.

983
01:13:23,432 --> 01:13:24,922
You don't know me.

984
01:13:26,335 --> 01:13:28,770
You have no idea who I am.

985
01:13:30,907 --> 01:13:33,171
I don't even know who I am!

986
01:13:34,443 --> 01:13:36,741
You are Carol Danvers.

987
01:13:38,014 --> 01:13:40,108
You are the woman
on that black box

988
01:13:40,216 --> 01:13:42,742
risking her life
to do the right thing.

989
01:13:44,553 --> 01:13:46,282
My best friend...

990
01:13:46,455 --> 01:13:49,390
who supported me
as a mother and a pilot

991
01:13:49,458 --> 01:13:50,926
when no one else did.

992
01:13:51,560 --> 01:13:56,623
You are smart, and funny,
and a huge pain in the ass...

993
01:13:56,799 --> 01:14:00,064
and you were the most
powerful person I knew...

994
01:14:00,236 --> 01:14:03,297
way before you could
shoot fire from your fists.

995
01:14:04,073 --> 01:14:05,472
You hear me?

996
01:14:06,909 --> 01:14:08,707
Do you hear me?

997
01:14:15,952 --> 01:14:17,943
Come here. Come here, girl.

998
01:14:18,621 --> 01:14:20,055
I got you.

999
01:14:24,293 --> 01:14:27,285
<i>I know
I don't deserve your trust...</i>

1000
01:14:27,563 --> 01:14:29,657
but you were our only lead.

1001
01:14:29,832 --> 01:14:32,096
We discovered
that your energy signature

1002
01:14:32,168 --> 01:14:34,933
matched Mar-Vell's core.

1003
01:14:35,771 --> 01:14:37,603
Now we know why.

1004
01:14:39,442 --> 01:14:43,401
If only you knew
the importance of it to me.

1005
01:14:44,513 --> 01:14:46,242
I just need your help

1006
01:14:46,315 --> 01:14:49,842
decoding the coordinates
to Mar-VelPs lab.

1007
01:14:50,586 --> 01:14:53,612
Those weren't coordinates.
They're state vectors.

1008
01:14:53,789 --> 01:14:55,689
For orbital position
and velocity.

1009
01:14:55,858 --> 01:14:57,587
You didn't find her lab
on Earth,

1010
01:14:57,660 --> 01:14:58,923
'cause it's not on Earth.

1011
01:14:59,095 --> 01:15:00,153
That was the location

1012
01:15:00,262 --> 01:15:01,320
on the date
of the crash six years ago.

1013
01:15:01,497 --> 01:15:02,862
If we track its course,

1014
01:15:02,965 --> 01:15:05,263
we'll find it in orbit
right now.

1015
01:15:05,434 --> 01:15:07,129
It's just basic physics.

1016
01:15:09,605 --> 01:15:10,595
In orbit?

1017
01:15:12,508 --> 01:15:14,101
Was that so difficult
to figure out'?

1018
01:15:14,276 --> 01:15:16,472
I mean'
you're my science guy, right?

1019
01:15:17,179 --> 01:15:19,671
Yon-Rogg will catch up
to me soon.

1020
01:15:19,849 --> 01:15:22,443
We've got to get to the core
before he does.

1021
01:15:22,651 --> 01:15:24,312
Mmm. We're going to space?

1022
01:15:24,487 --> 01:15:25,477
In what?

1023
01:15:25,654 --> 01:15:27,281
A few tweaks
to your vessel should do it.

1024
01:15:27,456 --> 01:15:29,550
I can handle the modifications.

1025
01:15:29,725 --> 01:15:31,386
Mmm. Your science guy.

1026
01:15:38,334 --> 01:15:39,859
Well, I could use a copilot.

1027
01:15:41,203 --> 01:15:43,638
No. No, I can't.

1028
01:15:43,806 --> 01:15:45,672
I can! Leave Monica.

1029
01:15:45,841 --> 01:15:48,640
Mom, it's okay. I can stay
with Gramma and Paw-paw.

1030
01:15:49,211 --> 01:15:51,236
There's no way I'm going,
baby. It's too dangerous.

1031
01:15:51,414 --> 01:15:53,348
Testing brand-new aerospace
tech is dangerous...

1032
01:15:53,516 --> 01:15:54,540
and you used to do that.

1033
01:15:56,352 --> 01:15:58,218
Your plan
is to leave the atmosphere

1034
01:15:58,320 --> 01:15:59,719
in a craft not designed
for the journey...

1035
01:15:59,889 --> 01:16:01,482
and you anticipate
hostile encounters...

1036
01:16:01,690 --> 01:16:02,714
with a technologically-superior

1037
01:16:02,825 --> 01:16:03,815
foreign enemy.

1038
01:16:04,360 --> 01:16:05,657
Correct?

1039
01:16:05,828 --> 01:16:06,818
That's what I'm saying.

1040
01:16:06,896 --> 01:16:08,159
- You have to go!
Monica!

1041
01:16:08,230 --> 01:16:09,391
You have a chance
to fly the coolest mission

1042
01:16:09,498 --> 01:16:10,590
in the history of missions...

1043
01:16:10,766 --> 01:16:12,530
and you're gonna give it up
to sit on the couch

1044
01:16:12,601 --> 01:16:13,864
and watch <i>Fresh Prince</i> with me?

1045
01:16:14,603 --> 01:16:15,593
What?

1046
01:16:15,738 --> 01:16:16,830
I just think
you should consider...

1047
01:16:17,006 --> 01:16:20,271
what kind of example you're
setting for your daughter.

1048
01:16:27,883 --> 01:16:29,214
What's going on around here?

1049
01:16:29,385 --> 01:16:30,375
I know, I know.

1050
01:16:30,453 --> 01:16:31,943
I'll explain inside.
Thank you.

1051
01:16:36,959 --> 01:16:39,223
Your mom's lucky.

1052
01:16:39,395 --> 01:16:40,692
When they were handing out kids,

1053
01:16:40,763 --> 01:16:42,424
they gave her the toughest one.

1054
01:16:43,032 --> 01:16:44,022
Lieutenant Trouble.

1055
01:16:45,034 --> 01:16:46,559
You remembered.

1056
01:16:48,037 --> 01:16:49,368
Is that mine?

1057
01:16:50,239 --> 01:16:51,707
No, no.

1058
01:16:52,408 --> 01:16:54,604
You hang on to it
until I come back.

1059
01:16:55,244 --> 01:16:57,645
But there is something
that I need your help with.

1060
01:16:57,880 --> 01:17:00,474
I can't wear
these Kree colors anymore.

1061
01:17:00,716 --> 01:17:03,708
And since you are obviously
the only person around here

1062
01:17:03,786 --> 01:17:05,618
with any sense of style...

1063
01:17:06,922 --> 01:17:07,980
Hmm?

1064
01:17:10,126 --> 01:17:11,150
Whoa.

1065
01:17:13,729 --> 01:17:14,924
No.

1066
01:17:17,266 --> 01:17:18,256
Uh-uh.

1067
01:17:19,735 --> 01:17:21,294
Definitely not.

1068
01:17:24,340 --> 01:17:26,638
Well, since we're
on the same team

1069
01:17:37,753 --> 01:17:38,914
Hmm.

1070
01:17:40,289 --> 01:17:41,848
How do I look?

1071
01:17:45,427 --> 01:17:46,690
Fresh.

1072
01:18:06,615 --> 01:18:07,844
What took you so long?

1073
01:18:08,684 --> 01:18:10,948
I'm fine. Thanks for asking.

1074
01:18:11,654 --> 01:18:13,986
- PRY46-B...
- No, no codes.

1075
01:18:14,190 --> 01:18:15,885
That system is fallible,
as we've learned.

1076
01:18:16,959 --> 01:18:18,654
Okay, then let's do this.

1077
01:18:19,361 --> 01:18:22,524
Who do I see when I commune
with the Supreme Intelligence?

1078
01:18:22,698 --> 01:18:25,395
The person you most admire
and respect' I'd guess.

1079
01:18:25,568 --> 01:18:26,797
But you would never tell me who.

1080
01:18:28,337 --> 01:18:31,398
And what is your
earliest memory of Hale?

1081
01:18:31,574 --> 01:18:33,064
The transfusion.

1082
01:18:33,242 --> 01:18:35,336
Blue blood
running through my veins.

1083
01:18:35,511 --> 01:18:36,501
Whose blood?

1084
01:18:39,248 --> 01:18:40,306
Hmm.

1085
01:18:47,656 --> 01:18:51,684
That's my blood that's
coursing through her veins.

1086
01:18:56,365 --> 01:18:57,696
What have you done with her?

1087
01:18:57,866 --> 01:18:59,834
You're too late.

1088
01:19:16,418 --> 01:19:17,442
She knows?

1089
01:19:32,134 --> 01:19:35,434
Ronan, Skrulls have
infiltrated C-53.

1090
01:19:35,604 --> 01:19:36,594
Come at once.

1091
01:19:36,772 --> 01:19:38,866
<i>For the good of all Kree,
Commander...</i>

1092
01:19:39,074 --> 01:19:41,873
<i>the infestation
will he eradicated.</i>

1093
01:19:44,046 --> 01:19:45,878
Passing 500 and climbing.

1094
01:19:48,884 --> 01:19:52,252
You know, you really shouldn't
have that thing on your lap.

1095
01:19:52,421 --> 01:19:55,584
Our little alliance with you
is tenuous at best.

1096
01:19:55,758 --> 01:19:58,455
And as long as he continues to
freak you out...

1097
01:19:58,627 --> 01:19:59,788
like that...

1098
01:19:59,962 --> 01:20:02,397
yeah, I'm gonna keep giving him

1099
01:20:02,464 --> 01:20:05,297
all the loves and hugs
that he needs, right?

1100
01:20:05,467 --> 01:20:07,060
Can I ask you something?

1101
01:20:07,236 --> 01:20:09,295
Do you just
turn into anything you want?

1102
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:11,132
Ah, well,
I have to see it first.

1103
01:20:11,307 --> 01:20:12,399
Can you all do it?

1104
01:20:12,841 --> 01:20:14,605
Physiologically? Yeah.

1105
01:20:14,777 --> 01:20:16,939
But, uh, it takes practice...

1106
01:20:17,112 --> 01:20:20,810
and, um, dare I say it,
talent to do it well.

1107
01:20:21,016 --> 01:20:23,485
- Can you turn into a cat?
- What's a cat?

1108
01:20:23,652 --> 01:20:24,744
What about a filing cabinet?

1109
01:20:25,321 --> 01:20:28,256
Why would I
turn into a filing cabinet?

1110
01:20:28,424 --> 01:20:29,482
A Venus flytrap?

1111
01:20:29,658 --> 01:20:30,648
I'll give you 50 bucks right now

1112
01:20:30,759 --> 01:20:31,954
if you turn into
a Venus flytrap.

1113
01:20:32,027 --> 01:20:33,688
Switching engines

1114
01:20:33,796 --> 01:20:36,094
from Scramjet to Fusion.
Buckle up, folks.

1115
01:20:45,274 --> 01:20:46,264
Hey.

1116
01:20:46,442 --> 01:20:48,934
Is this normal,
like, space turbulence?

1117
01:20:49,011 --> 01:20:50,001
Pretty much.

1118
01:21:23,746 --> 01:21:25,737
Locking in on coordinate grid.

1119
01:21:26,348 --> 01:21:27,543
Where is it?

1120
01:21:31,053 --> 01:21:33,818
It's here. It's got to be here.

1121
01:21:33,989 --> 01:21:39,223
Well, is it in front of all
that nothing, or behind it?

1122
01:21:44,767 --> 01:21:46,758
Decloaking activated.

1123
01:22:49,832 --> 01:22:51,561
Is that it? The core?

1124
01:22:51,733 --> 01:22:53,997
In her notes she called it
the Tesseract.

1125
01:23:00,142 --> 01:23:01,234
Whoa.

1126
01:23:02,811 --> 01:23:05,007
What was Lawson doing
with all this kid stuff?

1127
01:23:18,961 --> 01:23:19,985
We're not alone.

1128
01:23:43,151 --> 01:23:44,482
Talus!

1129
01:23:54,396 --> 01:23:57,297
He didn't come here
for the Tesseract.

1130
01:24:19,855 --> 01:24:21,050
It's okay.

1131
01:24:26,028 --> 01:24:27,655
We didn't know what to do.

1132
01:24:27,829 --> 01:24:31,094
Mar-Veil warned us not to send
a signal for any reason...

1133
01:24:31,266 --> 01:24:32,563
or the Kree would find us.

1134
01:24:33,001 --> 01:24:35,095
You did the right thing.

1135
01:24:44,713 --> 01:24:45,942
It's okay, it's okay.

1136
01:24:46,515 --> 01:24:48,574
She's all right.
She's a friend.

1137
01:24:50,619 --> 01:24:52,246
I am not gonna hurt you.

1138
01:24:52,554 --> 01:24:54,420
She led me to you.

1139
01:24:55,190 --> 01:24:56,680
I'm so sorry.

1140
01:24:58,393 --> 01:24:59,622
I didn't know.

1141
01:24:59,795 --> 01:25:00,853
Carol.

1142
01:25:01,697 --> 01:25:03,631
This is war.

1143
01:25:04,466 --> 01:25:07,868
My hands are
filthy from it, too.

1144
01:25:08,637 --> 01:25:10,401
But we're here now.

1145
01:25:10,806 --> 01:25:13,867
You found my family.

1146
01:25:16,912 --> 01:25:18,073
This is just the beginning.

1147
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:21,747
There are thousands of us
separated from each other...

1148
01:25:22,884 --> 01:25:25,581
scattered throughout the galaxy.

1149
01:25:43,338 --> 01:25:45,568
If I played the same pinball
machine for six years...

1150
01:25:45,741 --> 01:25:47,641
I'd have some high scores, too.

1151
01:25:50,278 --> 01:25:52,576
Fraternizing with the enemy?

1152
01:25:52,648 --> 01:25:53,774
Uh-uh.

1153
01:26:05,861 --> 01:26:07,829
What did you do to your uniform?

1154
01:26:07,996 --> 01:26:09,987
They got in her head.
Just like we thought.

1155
01:26:10,165 --> 01:26:11,826
The Supreme Intelligence will
set her straight.

1156
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:13,365
You can see
they're not soldiers.

1157
01:26:13,602 --> 01:26:15,866
Let 'em go. You can have me.

1158
01:26:16,038 --> 01:26:17,199
And the core?

1159
01:26:17,706 --> 01:26:19,037
You lied to me.

1160
01:26:19,207 --> 01:26:23,144
I made you
the best version of yourself.

1161
01:26:26,615 --> 01:26:29,516
What's given can be taken away.

1162
01:26:43,365 --> 01:26:44,355
Back here! Move, move!

1163
01:26:44,499 --> 01:26:46,968
Get over here. Get down!

1164
01:26:47,569 --> 01:26:50,163
Let's go! Go, move!

1165
01:27:29,578 --> 01:27:30,568
There she is.

1166
01:27:31,246 --> 01:27:34,773
Seems like your time on 0-53
jogged the old memory.

1167
01:27:35,684 --> 01:27:36,879
This jacket.

1168
01:27:37,519 --> 01:27:39,510
It's killer, by the way.

1169
01:27:41,022 --> 01:27:42,387
Oh.

1170
01:27:42,524 --> 01:27:44,515
The music.
It's a nice touch.

1171
01:27:44,793 --> 01:27:46,420
Let me out.

1172
01:27:46,595 --> 01:27:47,960
No can do.

1173
01:27:48,530 --> 01:27:52,228
If you hurt them,
I will burn you to the ground.

1174
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:54,129
With what exactly?

1175
01:27:54,302 --> 01:27:55,633
Your power comes from us.

1176
01:27:55,804 --> 01:27:57,568
You didn't give me these powers.

1177
01:27:57,739 --> 01:27:58,763
The blast did.

1178
01:27:58,940 --> 01:28:00,203
And yet, you've never had
the strength

1179
01:28:00,275 --> 01:28:01,401
to control them on your own.

1180
01:28:12,821 --> 01:28:14,448
Species: Flerken.

1181
01:28:14,556 --> 01:28:16,115
<i>Threat: high.</i>

1182
01:28:21,463 --> 01:28:23,329
It's a cat' not Hannibal Lecter.

1183
01:28:27,002 --> 01:28:28,470
Species: <i>human</i> male.

1184
01:28:28,637 --> 01:28:30,901
<i>Threat: low to none.</i>

1185
01:28:32,073 --> 01:28:33,336
That thing's clearly busted.

1186
01:28:33,508 --> 01:28:35,636
Load the Flerken
onto the Helion.

1187
01:28:36,444 --> 01:28:38,412
Eject the others into space.

1188
01:28:41,283 --> 01:28:43,308
You did good, Ace.

1189
01:28:44,953 --> 01:28:45,943
Thanks to you...

1190
01:28:46,121 --> 01:28:48,089
those insidious shapeshifters

1191
01:28:48,156 --> 01:28:49,681
will threaten
our borders no more.

1192
01:28:49,858 --> 01:28:52,122
I used to believe your lies...

1193
01:28:52,294 --> 01:28:54,922
but the Skrulls are
just fighting for a home.

1194
01:28:55,096 --> 01:28:56,621
You're talking
about destroying them

1195
01:28:56,698 --> 01:28:58,325
because they won't submit
to your rule.

1196
01:28:58,500 --> 01:28:59,592
And neither will I.

1197
01:28:59,768 --> 01:29:02,931
We found you.
We embraced you as our own.

1198
01:29:03,138 --> 01:29:04,537
You stole me.

1199
01:29:04,706 --> 01:29:07,437
From my home,
my family, my friends.

1200
01:29:15,517 --> 01:29:17,383
It's cute how hard you try.

1201
01:29:19,521 --> 01:29:21,182
But remember...

1202
01:29:22,524 --> 01:29:23,719
without us...

1203
01:29:23,892 --> 01:29:24,984
Give it up, Carol.

1204
01:29:26,695 --> 01:29:27,890
<i>Stay down!</i>

1205
01:29:28,063 --> 01:29:29,155
...you're weak.

1206
01:29:29,664 --> 01:29:31,393
<i>You're going too fast!
You need to go slow!</i>

1207
01:29:31,566 --> 01:29:32,897
You're flawed.

1208
01:29:33,068 --> 01:29:34,297
<i>Are you trying to kill yourself?</i>

1209
01:29:35,237 --> 01:29:36,227
Helpless.

1210
01:29:36,338 --> 01:29:37,396
<i>You're too emotional
and so weak.</i>

1211
01:29:37,806 --> 01:29:39,240
<i>You don't belong out here!</i>

1212
01:29:39,908 --> 01:29:41,342
We saved you.

1213
01:29:41,543 --> 01:29:43,033
- Control it.
<i>- I</i> told you,

1214
01:29:43,144 --> 01:29:44,134
- Carol.
- They'll never

1215
01:29:44,212 --> 01:29:45,202
<i>- let you fly.
- This ain't</i>

1216
01:29:45,313 --> 01:29:46,371
<i>- a game for little girls.
- You kiss like a horse.</i>

1217
01:29:46,481 --> 01:29:47,471
<i>You won't last a week, Danvers'</i>

1218
01:29:50,685 --> 01:29:53,746
Without us, you're only human.

1219
01:29:55,223 --> 01:29:56,486
You're right.

1220
01:29:57,726 --> 01:29:59,854
I'm only human.

1221
01:30:33,795 --> 01:30:37,129
<i>On Have, you were reborn...</i>

1222
01:30:37,299 --> 01:30:38,698
<i>Vers.</i>

1223
01:30:43,705 --> 01:30:46,606
My name is Carol.

1224
01:31:01,389 --> 01:31:02,948
She's trying to break out.

1225
01:31:47,268 --> 01:31:50,602
I've been fighting with one
arm tied behind my back.

1226
01:31:51,539 --> 01:31:53,132
But what happens when...

1227
01:31:56,277 --> 01:31:58,302
I'm finally set free?

1228
01:32:38,820 --> 01:32:41,346
You know you're glowing, right?

1229
01:32:41,523 --> 01:32:42,513
I'll explain it later.

1230
01:32:45,226 --> 01:32:46,387
Take the Tesseract.

1231
01:32:46,561 --> 01:32:47,687
Leave the lunchbox.

1232
01:32:47,862 --> 01:32:49,352
- Yes.

1233
01:32:49,531 --> 01:32:50,862
I'm not touching that thing.

1234
01:32:51,032 --> 01:32:52,090
You want me to
get you an oven mitt?

1235
01:32:57,939 --> 01:32:59,168
Whoa!

1236
01:33:05,780 --> 01:33:08,272
Get the Skrulls
on the Quadjet and go.

1237
01:33:08,450 --> 01:33:10,578
Take the Flerken with you.

1238
01:33:11,286 --> 01:33:13,015
- What about you?
<i>- I'll</i> buy you some time!

1239
01:33:14,923 --> 01:33:16,755
I'm picking you up now.

1240
01:33:19,894 --> 01:33:22,192
I'm trusting you not to eat me.

1241
01:33:27,602 --> 01:33:28,592
0h, hey, guys.

1242
01:33:32,474 --> 01:33:34,135
Arm wrestle for the Tesseract?

1243
01:33:37,278 --> 01:33:39,144
I used to find you amusing.

1244
01:33:39,881 --> 01:33:40,871
Let's put an end to this.

1245
01:34:16,317 --> 01:34:17,284
<i>Okay.</i>

1246
01:34:17,752 --> 01:34:18,947
Good kitty.

1247
01:35:05,466 --> 01:35:07,195
You knew all along.

1248
01:35:08,336 --> 01:35:09,462
Is that why we never hung out?

1249
01:35:09,637 --> 01:35:10,729
No, I just never liked you.

1250
01:35:18,012 --> 01:35:19,002
Incoming!

1251
01:35:27,522 --> 01:35:28,512
Hey, in a hurry?

1252
01:35:30,758 --> 01:35:32,522
Don't make me do this.

1253
01:35:32,760 --> 01:35:33,750
<i>Okay.</i>

1254
01:35:49,611 --> 01:35:50,601
Come on, do your thing!

1255
01:35:51,846 --> 01:35:52,904
Come on!

1256
01:35:55,250 --> 01:35:56,684
Come on!

1257
01:35:59,787 --> 01:36:01,186
Damn it, Goose.

1258
01:36:01,256 --> 01:36:02,382
Pick a side.

1259
01:36:06,594 --> 01:36:08,460
Take them to the hangar, too.

1260
01:36:08,630 --> 01:36:10,428
We'll blast them all into space.

1261
01:36:12,533 --> 01:36:13,523
Play it cool.

1262
01:36:15,036 --> 01:36:16,367
Just like Havana.

1263
01:36:18,139 --> 01:36:20,267
Do you have the thing?

1264
01:36:20,441 --> 01:36:21,966
Flerken kitty ate it.

1265
01:36:35,390 --> 01:36:36,755
Come on, move!

1266
01:36:36,924 --> 01:36:38,085
Move!

1267
01:36:38,660 --> 01:36:39,957
Follow my lead.

1268
01:36:43,965 --> 01:36:44,955
Cover her eyes.

1269
01:36:53,474 --> 01:36:54,964
Onto the ship!

1270
01:36:55,176 --> 01:36:56,905
Let's go! Let's go!

1271
01:37:19,767 --> 01:37:21,758
Nice diversion.

1272
01:37:22,136 --> 01:37:23,865
I could have swore
I put it in there.

1273
01:38:20,895 --> 01:38:22,989
Minn-Erva, take them down
in the drop ship.

1274
01:38:23,164 --> 01:38:24,222
On it.

1275
01:38:28,903 --> 01:38:30,029
You all right, friend?

1276
01:38:31,105 --> 01:38:33,039
Never better.

1277
01:38:37,845 --> 01:38:39,609
We got a bogey coming in hot.

1278
01:40:19,514 --> 01:40:21,141
Yes! Boom!

1279
01:40:37,164 --> 01:40:38,359
<i>Whom!</i>

1280
01:40:41,702 --> 01:40:43,033
What the hell was that?

1281
01:41:06,427 --> 01:41:08,555
Deploy ballistic warheads.

1282
01:42:00,815 --> 01:42:02,249
That's impossible.

1283
01:42:02,416 --> 01:42:04,783
C-53 doesn't have
a defense system

1284
01:42:04,885 --> 01:42:07,479
advanced enough
to destroy our warheads.

1285
01:42:08,956 --> 01:42:11,448
That's not
their defense system, Ronan.

1286
01:42:15,930 --> 01:42:17,091
Take her down.

1287
01:42:37,018 --> 01:42:38,076
<i>Whom!</i>

1288
01:43:27,668 --> 01:43:29,568
Return to the jump point.

1289
01:43:30,638 --> 01:43:32,732
We'll be back for the weapon.

1290
01:43:34,308 --> 01:43:35,503
The core?

1291
01:43:37,344 --> 01:43:38,641
The woman.

1292
01:44:26,761 --> 01:44:28,229
I'm so proud of you.

1293
01:44:30,231 --> 01:44:31,596
You've come a long way

1294
01:44:31,699 --> 01:44:33,633
since I found you
that day by the lake.

1295
01:44:34,201 --> 01:44:36,295
But can you keep
your emotions in check

1296
01:44:36,403 --> 01:44:38,599
long enough to take me on?

1297
01:44:38,773 --> 01:44:41,435
Or will they get the better
of you as always?

1298
01:44:42,977 --> 01:44:44,638
I always told you...

1299
01:44:44,812 --> 01:44:46,109
you'll be ready

1300
01:44:46,213 --> 01:44:48,545
the day you can knock me down
as yourself.

1301
01:44:48,716 --> 01:44:50,150
This is that moment.

1302
01:44:50,317 --> 01:44:52,809
This is that moment, Vers!

1303
01:44:52,987 --> 01:44:54,079
Turn off the light show...

1304
01:44:54,255 --> 01:44:57,589
and prove to me
you can beat me without...

1305
01:45:13,107 --> 01:45:15,098
I have nothing to prove to you.

1306
01:45:30,958 --> 01:45:32,983
Destination: Hala.

1307
01:45:33,160 --> 01:45:34,787
I can't go back empty-handed.

1308
01:45:34,962 --> 01:45:36,691
You won't be empty-handed.

1309
01:45:36,864 --> 01:45:39,162
I'm sending you with a message.

1310
01:45:39,333 --> 01:45:42,496
Tell the Supreme Intelligence
that I'm coming to end it.

1311
01:45:42,670 --> 01:45:45,435
The war. The lies.
All of it.

1312
01:45:47,308 --> 01:45:48,673
You can't do this.

1313
01:46:07,561 --> 01:46:11,156
That was a close call,
huh, Goosey? Huh?

1314
01:46:12,333 --> 01:46:13,698
Those bad guys
still in there somewhere?

1315
01:46:13,801 --> 01:46:14,859
Ow!

1316
01:46:14,969 --> 01:46:16,198
Mother Flerken!

1317
01:46:16,370 --> 01:46:17,462
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1318
01:46:17,905 --> 01:46:19,464
It's just a scratch.

1319
01:46:19,840 --> 01:46:21,137
No.

1320
01:46:28,682 --> 01:46:30,514
I can't believe

1321
01:46:30,584 --> 01:46:31,983
you got in the raddest
dogfight ever...

1322
01:46:32,086 --> 01:46:33,485
and I missed it.

1323
01:46:33,654 --> 01:46:35,213
I'd say you arrived
just in time.

1324
01:46:35,389 --> 01:46:37,414
Some nifty flying
you did out there.

1325
01:46:37,591 --> 01:46:39,582
S.H.I.E.L.D. could always use
a good pilot like you.

1326
01:46:39,760 --> 01:46:41,489
I'll consider it...

1327
01:46:41,662 --> 01:46:44,654
as long as you never
call my flying "nifty" again.

1328
01:46:44,832 --> 01:46:45,993
How's your eye?

1329
01:46:46,066 --> 01:46:48,194
Hmm. Getting better
every second.

1330
01:46:48,369 --> 01:46:49,564
Just so I'm clear...

1331
01:46:49,737 --> 01:46:51,102
<i>you were Soh-Larr...</i>

1332
01:46:51,272 --> 01:46:53,331
- and the S.H.I.E.L.D. agent?
- Keller.

1333
01:46:53,841 --> 01:46:56,173
He tied my boss up,
stole his identity.

1334
01:46:56,343 --> 01:46:59,176
I borrowed his likeness.
I'm no thief.

1335
01:46:59,346 --> 01:47:00,575
It is a little like stealing.

1336
01:47:00,748 --> 01:47:02,045
Whose side are you on here?

1337
01:47:02,416 --> 01:47:03,884
You're good to go here
until you recover...

1338
01:47:04,051 --> 01:47:07,077
but you and your family
are gonna need a new look.

1339
01:47:07,254 --> 01:47:08,847
I could go back
to being your boss.

1340
01:47:09,023 --> 01:47:10,013
Uh, please don't.

1341
01:47:10,190 --> 01:47:13,023
Come on. I loved sporting
his beautiful blue eyes.

1342
01:47:13,193 --> 01:47:15,525
No way.
You guys have the best eyes.

1343
01:47:15,729 --> 01:47:17,697
Don't ever change your eyes.

1344
01:47:17,765 --> 01:47:19,233
She has beautiful eyes.
That's very sweet of you.

1345
01:47:19,300 --> 01:47:20,961
I was trying not to panic...

1346
01:47:21,135 --> 01:47:22,603
I'll help you find a home.

1347
01:47:23,704 --> 01:47:24,796
Finish what Mar-Veil started.

1348
01:47:26,907 --> 01:47:29,069
They can stay here with us.

1349
01:47:29,276 --> 01:47:30,801
Can't they, Mom?

1350
01:47:30,978 --> 01:47:32,912
They won't be safe here, baby.

1351
01:47:33,547 --> 01:47:35,072
Auntie Carol's right.

1352
01:47:35,249 --> 01:47:36,239
They need their own home.

1353
01:47:37,451 --> 01:47:39,249
I'll be back before you know it.

1354
01:47:39,720 --> 01:47:42,985
Or maybe I could fly up
and meet you halfway?

1355
01:47:43,157 --> 01:47:45,956
Ah, only if you learn to glow
like your Auntie Carol.

1356
01:47:46,126 --> 01:47:47,491
Or maybe I'll build a spaceship.

1357
01:47:47,594 --> 01:47:49,323
- You don't know.
- He doesn't.

1358
01:47:59,106 --> 01:48:01,507
Keep the Tesseract on Earth.

1359
01:48:02,242 --> 01:48:03,232
Hidden.

1360
01:48:03,410 --> 01:48:05,435
You sure that's what
Marvel would want?

1361
01:48:06,113 --> 01:48:07,171
Mar-Vell.

1362
01:48:07,348 --> 01:48:08,645
That's what I said.

1363
01:48:08,816 --> 01:48:11,148
It's two words. Mar. Vell.

1364
01:48:11,318 --> 01:48:12,649
Mar-Vell.

1365
01:48:12,820 --> 01:48:13,912
"Marvel" sounds a lot better.

1366
01:48:13,988 --> 01:48:15,285
You know, like the Marvelettes.

1367
01:48:29,203 --> 01:48:30,261
Not ringing any bells?

1368
01:48:30,437 --> 01:48:32,201
Keep singing.
Maybe it'll come back to me.

1369
01:48:47,554 --> 01:48:49,044
I upgraded it.

1370
01:48:49,690 --> 01:48:52,159
Range should be
a couple galaxies, at least.

1371
01:48:54,795 --> 01:48:56,991
What? You think
I'm gonna crank call you?

1372
01:48:57,164 --> 01:49:00,691
For emergencies only, okay?

1373
01:49:05,339 --> 01:49:07,467
Well...

1374
01:49:08,175 --> 01:49:10,405
if you're ever passing
back through this galaxy...

1375
01:49:10,577 --> 01:49:12,636
be sure to give
a brother a shout.

1376
01:49:14,848 --> 01:49:16,680
Om

1377
01:49:29,396 --> 01:49:31,421
We got the ketchup stain off.

1378
01:49:36,870 --> 01:49:38,668
Thanks, Lieutenant Trouble.

1379
01:49:40,674 --> 01:49:41,869
Hmm.

1380
01:49:47,948 --> 01:49:50,542
It's hard for me
to say goodbye, too.

1381
01:50:04,231 --> 01:50:05,392
Go on.

1382
01:51:12,466 --> 01:51:15,197
Glad to have you back, sir.
This came for you.

1383
01:51:20,140 --> 01:51:21,335
So, is it true?

1384
01:51:22,442 --> 01:51:23,637
That the Kree
burned your eye out...

1385
01:51:23,844 --> 01:51:26,211
because you refused
to give them the Tesseract?

1386
01:51:27,181 --> 01:51:30,845
I will neither confirm nor
deny the facts of that story.

1387
01:51:31,118 --> 01:51:32,176
Understood.

1388
01:51:33,720 --> 01:51:34,710
I'm sorry to report

1389
01:51:34,821 --> 01:51:35,811
that we still haven't
found the Tesseract.

1390
01:51:35,989 --> 01:51:38,185
I'm sure it'll turn up
somewhere.

1391
01:51:39,826 --> 01:51:41,521
I'll let you know when it does.

1392
01:51:41,695 --> 01:51:43,060
Then what?

1393
01:51:43,630 --> 01:51:44,620
Sir?

1394
01:51:44,998 --> 01:51:46,124
We have no idea

1395
01:51:46,200 --> 01:51:49,226
what other intergalactic
threats are out there.

1396
01:51:49,403 --> 01:51:51,394
And our one-woman security force

1397
01:51:51,505 --> 01:51:52,734
had a prior commitment...

1398
01:51:52,906 --> 01:51:54,670
on the other side
of the universe.

1399
01:51:57,511 --> 01:51:59,536
S.H.l.E.I.D. alone
can't protect us.

1400
01:52:01,315 --> 01:52:02,840
We need to find more.

1401
01:52:03,150 --> 01:52:04,140
More weapons?

1402
01:52:04,318 --> 01:52:05,911
More heroes.

1403
01:52:06,186 --> 01:52:07,711
You think you can find
others like her?

1404
01:52:07,821 --> 01:52:10,813
Hmm, we found her,
and we weren't even looking.

1405
01:52:11,892 --> 01:52:13,189
Get some rest, sir.

1406
01:52:14,261 --> 01:52:16,093
You got a big decision to make.

1407
01:55:15,242 --> 01:55:16,903
This is a nightmare.

1408
01:55:18,612 --> 01:55:20,842
I've had better nightmares.

1409
01:55:23,016 --> 01:55:24,040
Hey.

1410
01:55:25,118 --> 01:55:27,212
So, that thing just stopped

1411
01:55:27,287 --> 01:55:29,016
doing whatever the hell
it was doing.

1412
01:55:30,924 --> 01:55:32,722
What do we got?

1413
01:55:33,627 --> 01:55:35,925
Whatever signal it was sending
finally crapped out.

1414
01:55:36,129 --> 01:55:37,187
I thought
we bypassed the battery.

1415
01:55:37,264 --> 01:55:38,254
We did.

1416
01:55:38,432 --> 01:55:41,265
It's still plugged in.
It just stopped.

1417
01:55:42,202 --> 01:55:43,931
Reboot it.
Send the signal again.

1418
01:55:44,104 --> 01:55:45,538
We don't even know what this is.

1419
01:55:45,705 --> 01:55:48,072
Fury did. Just do it, please.

1420
01:55:48,375 --> 01:55:50,867
You tell me
the second you get a signal.

1421
01:55:51,044 --> 01:55:53,536
I wanna know who's on
the other end of that thing.

1422
01:55:56,450 --> 01:55:57,884
Where's Fury?
